Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight
We take on the world with hatred inside
Mayhem the reason we fight
Surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer then move on ahead

Evil
My words defy
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul
Evil
My wrath unfolds

Satan our master in evil mayhem
Guides us with every first step
Our axes are growing with power and fury
Soon there'll be nothingness left
Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
Evil is at our command
We clash with God's angel and conquer new souls
Consuming all that we can


Screams and nightmares
Of a life I want
Can't see living this lie no
A world I haunt
You've lost all control of my
Heart and soul
Satan holds my future
Watch it unfold

I am the Antichrist
It's what I was meant to be
Your God left me behind
And set my soul to be free

Watching disciples
Of the satanic rule
Pentagram of blood
Holds the jackal's truth
Searching for the answer
Christ hasn't come
Awaiting the final moment
The birth of Satan's son

Screams,
From a life I live
Torment,
Is what I give
Torture,
Is what I love
The down fall,
Of the heavens above

I am the Antichrist
All love is lost
Insanity is what I am
Eternally my soul will rot (rot... rot)


Live by the sword and help to contain
The helpless minds of you all
Die by my hand in pools of blood
Clutch yourself as you fall
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
Children slaughtered in vain
Raping the maids, in which they serve
Only the words of the Lord

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

Satan watches all of us
Smiles as some do his bidding
Try to escape the grasp of my hand
And your life will no longer exist
Hear our cry, save us from
The Hell in which we live
We turn our heads toward the sky
And listen for the steel

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

Watch as flowers decay
On (the) cryptic life that died
The wisdom of the wizards
Is only a neurtured lie
Black knights of Hell's domain
Walk upon the dead
Satanas sits upon
The blood on which he feeds

Die by the sword
Die by the sword


Metal and men clash once more to the end
Warriors above with the power to kill descend
Militia of blood troops of hate march to die
Soldiers of Hell veterans of death arise

Prepare for attack
Your body will burn
Endless war
There's no return
Prepare for attack
Death will arrive
Your orders are clear
No way to hide
Fight till death

Senseless death of all mankind overtakes
Armored assassins destroy at will your escape
Children of sorrow are trampled into the grave
There is no future no (fucking) world to (be) save(d).

Gods of steel unleash their destruction on man
Reign of death what is the final command
Sceptors of hate are dropped upon this Earth
Clouds of terror destroy all hope of rebirth


A misty night, a perfect night
Beneath the cold of the frozen star
You feel the fright, you know I'm near
You never should have come this far
I am alive, you can't kill me
I will survive eternity

Go through the fire walk past the dead
Lost in my eternal maze
Your heart pounds through the mist filled air
Your concentration breaks for me to strike
You've cowered down, you've broken the chain
Now I can freeze your burning eyes

You see me lift the axe, (as) it plunges through your shield
You now begin to panic as you see your chances grow slim
Your running through the endless maze
(You) Turn and I'll be there
A force too strong for you to fight
Your end I'll see tonight ("I'll see your end tonight")

You think you can destroy (me)? You'd better think again
I am eternal terror my quest will never end
I'll trap you in the pentagram
And seal your battered tomb
Your life is just another game
For Satan's night of doom


Cursed
Black magic night
We've been struck down
Down in this Hell
Spells surround me day and night
Stricken by the force of evil light
The force of evil light

Cast
Under his spell
Blinding my eyes
Twisting my mind
Fight to resist the evil inside
Captive of a force of Satan's might
A force of Satan's might

Fighting the curse
Break it I must
Laughing in sorrow
Crying in lust

My strength slips fast
Soon I must fall
Victim of fortune
My sources grow small
Life slips away
As demons come forth
Death takes my hand
And captures my soul


Afraid to walk the streets
In the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night
Engulfs your flesh and bones
Hoping for relief
From the fear you feel inside
Losing all perspective
Of reality in the night

Running from shadows
Blinded by fear
The horror of nightfall
Is ever so near
I slowly surround you
As terror sets in
Are you afraid of the night

I see the fright in your eyes
As you turn and run
But is your mind playing tricks
On a body so very young
Feeling as if no one cares
The fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest
Until I know you're mine

Afraid to walk the streets
In the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night
Engulfs your flesh and bones
Feeling as if no one cares
The fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest
Until I know you're mine
I know you're mine
Too late to hide
Too late to save your life
Tormentor


Screams of terror across the sea
Begging for mercy in their one final plea
Soldiers prepare to fight to the death
Fighting and killing to their very last breath
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Born with the power of God in his hand
He makes his move to conquer the land
Turning all hopes of life to sand

Machine gun fire, blood level higher
Visions of torture and terror to all
Ready for battle awaiting the final command

Hiding in darkness from enemies unseen
Awaiting our victory ending his dream
Cursed are the souls who defy his will
All of which are tortured and ruthlessly killed
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Born with the power of God in his hand
Shocking the world with his mass devastation
He puts all his power in the trust of one nation

At the crack of dawn they storm again
Hunting, fighting and killing all men
The end is near our time now short
Our kingdoms have fallen as a result of his sport
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Born with the power of God in his hand
Withdrawn from fighting he now takes his leave
Seeking out goals that can't be conceived


Eyes upon me
Watching me in my perpetual sleep
Dreams deceive me
My future depends on a mindless dream
I've fallen from promises
Damned to take risks on my own
The masterful science that freezes your
Mind and your soul
The wretched dream is realized
The human race is to be crystallized

Thoughts of laughter
Filling the head of the master in charge.
Worlds of wonder
Is this a cure or a painless death
I'll fight and resist
Till they all see the end that is near
The doctors the lawers and G-men
Are living in fear
Living my life with one distant hope
A cure that will kill my invincible foe


Through the night we rise in pairs
Lords at night we ride
From the depths of Hell's domain
Reborn to reign this night
Roam throughout the endless wars
Hold high his name we must
Warriors from the gates of Hell
In Lord Satan we trust

Stalking the night can't you feel I'm near
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing my force ("...their fate") [1:st & 3:rd time]

Brothers of the Prince of Night
By bargains we have made
Allies with the darkened souls
Our legions we must save
Fight for our eternal quest
God can't save you in time
Evil stalks the night with us
Your soul it shall be mine

I am the menace in your eyes
The one you can't escape
Your life falls in my grasp
Your know your end is near
You pray your God will help
His strength no match for mine
Your last hope slips away
Thy soul begins to bleed
I tear your flesh to shreds
Burn holes throughout your mind
Your eyes now filled with blood
A victim of my force
In endless agony
You realize your defeat
Recite my Master's chants
Your soul now his to keep


Frantic minds are terrified
Life lies in a grave
Silent death rides high above
On the wings of revelation
Multi death from chemicals
Arrogance has won
Annihilation must be swift
Destroy without destruction

Gods on the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
Bodies lie dormant no life
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell
Demons not ready to die
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie

Chemical warfare

Artificial fucking peace
Line up in a death row
Generals in their slow defeat
Diminished from this hell
Banished from the dying world
The lords of hell await
Dogs of war are helpless prey
To immortality

Gods on the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
Bodies lie dormant no life
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell
Demons not ready to die
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie

Chemical warfare!!!

Fuck it up!

Liquidate
The torture kills the troops that try to fight
Terminate
Human pesticide bring days of doom
Mist falls
The deadly gas that brings them to their knees
Sacrifice
Steal the soul and send his corpse to hell

Hahahahahaha

Mummified regions lying in dust
Fall victim to this game
Petrified corpses bathing in rust
Taken without being blamed
Falsified spirits farther they fall
Soon they will join us in hell
See the sky burning the gates are ablaze
Satan awaits eager to merge

Gods on the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
Bodies lie dormant no life
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell
Demons not ready to die
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie

Chemical warfare

Warfare!


Harlots of Hell spread your wings
As I penetrate your soul
Feel the fire shoot through your body
As I slip into your throne
Cast aside, do as you will
I care not how you plead
Satan's child now stalks the earth
Born from my demon seed

Hot winds of Hell
Burns, in my wake
Death is what you pray,
Behold, captor of sin

Infernal slaves of manipulation
Captive of my vice
Abandon God, the helpless one
To relieve you of your plight
Subversive action will not help
It will strengthen me
I see decline in your every move
Death your final plea

Hot winds of Hell
Burns, in my wake
Death is what you pray,
Behold, captor of sin

Your skin turns to leather
I ignite your timid blood
You feel my lethal touch
As I grasp your weary soul
I'll take you down into the fire


The holy cross
Symbol of lies
Intimitade the lives of Christian born
Speak of death
The words of hate
Anticipation grows amongst the dead
Hell has seen
The priests attempt
To bring forth their lord of the cross
Strike of twelve
Raise the dead
The chapel comes under attack

The ghosts of sin
Torment the priests
Their altar will soon be destroyed
Heaven's palace
Turning black
The church now belongs to the dead
Blackened magic
Infest with lust
Lucifer rules supreme
The crystal ball shows unknown fate
The last thing that's heard is the screams

Ghosts from hell invade this feeble shrine
Heaven's holy house will fall in time
Satan's morbid soldiers chant in lust
Destruction of the church we'll burn the cross

Attacking angels as they pray to god
Tormented preachers hail the twisted cross
Haunting the chapel
Hell's demons prevail
Death has come
The house of god has failed


Follow me, I'll lead the way; your fears will soon overtake
Hide your infinite tears inside, it seeks your smallest break
Screaming as if nothing helps, you press on to survive
Playing out the fantasies of a force that keeps you alive

He'll have you down on your knees
You play his fatal game
He'll satisfy your every need
You'll never be the same

Take my hand, I'll show you how;
You've just one life to live
The road you're on goes straight to hell;
Your life is yours to give
His fantasies of all of you are much too great to see
This world your living is so unreal, perfected just for me

He'll have you down on your knees
You play his fatal game
He'll satisfy your every need
You'll never be the same


Existing on damnation's edge
The priest had never known
To witness such a violent show
Of power overthrown

Angels fighting aimlessly
Still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight
To get the one called Lord

The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Crucify the so called Lord
He soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned your God has fell
To slave for me eternally
Hell awaits...

The Reaper guard's the darkened Gates
That Satan calls his home
Demons feed the furnace where
The Dead are free to roam

Lonely children of the night
There's seven ways to go
Each leading to the burning hole
The Lucifer controls

Priests of Hades seek the sacred star
Satan sees the answer lies not far
Zombies screaming souls cry out to you
Satanic laws prevail your life is through

Pray to the moon... when it is round
Death with you shall then abound
What you seek... for can't be found
In sea or sky or underground

Now I have you deep inside my everlasting grasp
The seven bloody Gates of Hell
Is where you'll live your last

Warriors from Hell's Domain
Will bring you to your Death
The flames of Hades burning strong
Your soul shall never rest

The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Sacrifice the lives of all I know they
Soon shall die
Their souls are damned to rot in Hell
and keep the fire growing deep inside
Hell awaits...


Lurking in the dismal fog
Hungry for your blood
Seeking harmless victims
Satisfy my needs

Schizophrenic lunatic
Uncontrolled desire
Rape and ravage lady fair
Pledged to die

No apparent motive
Just kill and kill again
Survive my brutal thrashing
I'll hunt you till the end
My life's a constant battle
The rage of many men
Homicidal maniac...

Trapped in mortal solitude
Lift the gleaming blade
Slice her flesh to shreds
Watch the blood flow free

Hatred growing stronger
None survive my wrath
Suffer from the throbbing pain
Yield your life to me

Kill the preacher's only son
Watch the infant die
Bodily dismemberment
Drink the purest blood
Unrelenting need to kill
Death upon you now
Anxiously awaiting
Next in line.

(KILL AGAIN)


Awakened I have become
Light now slips away
Manipulate your mind
Darkness is my slave

Taste the sins of Hell
The blood that I so crave
The last thing that you see
Is the hunger in my eyes

Blood sucking creatures of the night
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
Cries screaming out every fright
Eagerly awaiting plight
Apparitions from the pits of Hell
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell
Demented lust, the secrets they must keep
Addicted to your blood
At dawn they sleep

Unveil the hidden coffin
Lift the lid of terror
Feel the deadly cold
Freeze you from inside

Perceiving your intentions
To slay the phantom form
Raise the stake in malice
You cannot plunge it down

Beware the image unseen
Stalks your soul
Your corpse's redeem

Eternal damnation you just reward
A servant of our Lord
By your accord

Admonish of the cruciform
Impalement
Immortality's scorned

Rise hold fast your faith
To lie dormant
Is certain Death

(Driven by the instinct of centuries of horror
Implanted along the brain of the sickening parasite
Linked together by one trait
The Hell-filled need to kill... kill... kill... kill... KILL)

Emerging from their Hellish tomb
Taking flight amidst the night
The evening skies are raining Death

Swooping down from shadowed skies
Taking simple human form
Shed their wings to stalk the mortal man

Lock their jaws into your veins
Satanic soldiers strike their prey
Leaving corpses waiting for the change

Blood dripping from the jaws of Death
Not enough to satisfy
They must drain your soul of life


Deceased in mind decree of Death
Blackened heart baptized in fire
Exertion now need to blitz
Vicious ways brought up in Hell

Draw the line Life or Death
Potent thrust excessive pain
Massive dose adrenalin
Minor threat can not decline

Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound we lie
Praise of Death life's a dream
We're only living to die

Victim of life insanity lives
Deep in shock intensive care
Tables turned blast of strength
Kill at once time to prevail

Begin to crank feel the rush
Start to rage take to extremes
Push too far overkill
Time to die no way to win

Running and hunting and slashing
and crushing and searching
and seeing and stabbing and shooting
and thrashing and smashing and
burning destroying and killing
and bleeding and pleading then Death

At Mach ten velocity
Pressure builds can't take the strain
Life blood flows to its grave
Dripping sweat, Death shall erase

Time to think time to breath
Feel the pulse life will expire
Surging speed Hell afast
Cardiac cease to exist


Mortuaries, dead of night
My body starts to rise
In my mind the horror lives
To feel death deep inside

Relentless lust of rotting flesh
To thrash the tomb she lies
Heathen whore of Satan's wrath
I spit at your demise

Virgin child now drained of life
Your soul cannot be free
Not given the chance to rot in Hell

Satan's cross points to Hell
The earth I must uncover
A passion grows to feast upon
The frozen blood inside her

I feel the urge the growing need
To fuck this sinful corpse
My tasks complete the bitch's soul
Lies raped in demonic lust

Her stomach bursts the casket breaks
The seed has taken form
A writhing shape of twisted flesh
The Devil's child is thrown

Hungry for the smell of Death
He rules forbidden evil
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred
The bastard now must die

Lost souls of the dead
Form legions that burst through Hell's Gates
Death of one sacrifice
To avenge the raped corpse from the grave
Blood of one mortal man
The fire grows stronger within
Fate of a frenzied lust
Lucifer takes my dark soul

Down to the fiery pits of Hell
(Down to the fiery pits of HELL)


Devious to those unknown
He walks below the land
Alluring victims to their death
Perish to the sand

Master of the blackened arts
Living his decree
Thrives amongst the Seven Gates
Searching for the keys

I have seen the darkened depths of Hell
Sorcery beyond the witches' spell
Robbed the crypts of Death's eternity
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly

Chants of evil incantation
Fill the murky night
Free the Devil's knights of Hell
Unleash their growing spite

Directing power forcibly
The fire of Hell is cast
Resurrect from crypts of Death
A demon from the past

Cringe with fear
Violate the unbroken seal of Hell
Death will come searching for
Your mere soul
Still you are eager to seek your fate
All that lie here are remains of Death

Grinding bones, screaming skulls
Broken by the lapse of time
Decay to powder, ashes to dust
Diminishing, disintegrating
Man's soul and mind

Empty space tracks throughout
I make my claim

Darkness covers the world
My Kingdom, my Domain


Fear runs wild in the veins of the world
The hate turns the skies jet black
Death is assured in future plans
Why live if there's nothing there

Spectors of doom await the moment
The mallet is sure and precise
Cover the crypts of all mankind
With cloven hoove begone

Sadistic minds
Delay the death
Of twisted life
Malicious world

The crippled youth try in dismay
To sabotage the carcass Earth
All new life must perish below
Existence now is futile

Decrepit breath, vile in its stench
A world in decay
Transgressor is as one

Convulsions take the world in hand
Paralysis destroys
Nobody's out there to save us
Brutal seizure now we die

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in
Like cattle
You run
Stripped of
Your life's worth
Human mice, for the Angel of Death
Four hundred thousand more to die
Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood

Destroying, without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race

Surgery, with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down screaming out to die
Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher,
Angel of Death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh, drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold, cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time
'Til you rip yourselves apart
Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The holocaust
Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down,
Your blood running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants he's creating
Pathetic harmless victims
Left to die
Rancid Angel of Death
Flying free

Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher,
Angel of Death

Angel of Death


Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny

As soon as life has left your corpse
I'll make you part of me
No emotion
Death is all I see

Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

Bones and blood lie on the ground
Rotten limbs lie dead
Decapitated bodies found
On my wall, your head!

On your trail I close the gap
One more life that soon won't be
No emotion
Your flesh is all I need

I'll send you to your maker
Confront the God you seek
A flash of red upon his your chest
Safety out of reach

(You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny)

(Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
There's only one way out of here
Piece by piece)


Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged

Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair?

Ripping apart
Severing flesh
Gouging eyes
Tearing limb from limb

Experimentation, slow infection, internal decay
Execution, need transfusion, body rots away

Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine

Ripping apart
Severing flesh
Gouging eyes
Tearing limb from limb

Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged

Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair

Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine

Necrophobic can't control the paranoia
Scared to die


Waiting the hour destined to die
Here on the table of hell
A figure in white unknown by man
Approaching the altar of death
High priest awaiting dagger in hand
Spilling the pure virgin blood
Satan's slaughter, ceremonial death
Answer his every command

Death will come easy just close your eyes -
Dream of the friends you'll see
Heavenly failure losing again
Move on to a new form of life

Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
Confronting the evil you dread
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul
Soon you will meet the undead

(Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
Confronting the evil you dread
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul
Soon you will meet the undead)

Enter to the realm of Satan!

Blood turning black, the change has begun
Feeling the hatred of all damned in Hell
Flesh starts to burn, twist and deform
Eyes dripping blood realization of death
Transforming of five toes to two
Learn the sacred words of praise, hail Satan

A gift of powers disposed upon you
Use them when you feel the need
Master the forces and powers of Satan
Controlling the creature's instinct
Drawn to the castles that float in the sky
Learn to resist the temptation
Watching the angels sift through the heavens
Endlessly searching for salvation


You go to the church, you kiss the cross
You will be saved at any cost
You have your own reality
Christianity
You spend your life just kissing ass
A trait that's grown as time has passed
You think the world will end today
You praise the Lord, it's all you say

Jesus saves, listen to you pray
You think you'll see the pearly gates
When death takes you away

For all respect you cannot lust
In an invisible man you place your trust
Indirect dependency
Eternal attempt at amnesty
He will decide who lives and dies
Depopulate Satanas rise
You will be an accessory
Irreverence and blasphemy

Jesus saves, no need to pray
The gates of pearl have turned to gold
It seems you've lost your way

Jesus saves, no words of praise
No promised land to take you to
There is no other way


Night will come and I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast, your time of sorrow
On his trail, I'll make you follow

Quarters for the criminally insane
The sentence read for life I must remain
The path I chose has led me to my grave
To try again I'd have no other way

Quarters for the criminally insane
Escape for me has fast become a game
Soon to be, I'll leave without a trace
Endangered species end the human race

Branded in pain
Marked criminally insane
Locked away and kept restrained
Disapprobation, but what have I done
I have yet only just begun
To take your fuckin' lives!

(Night will come and I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast, your time of sorrow
On his trail, I'll make you follow)


Convicted witch my life will end
At midnight on the stake
My dedicated life was spent
To insubordinate
Secured by lock inside a cell
Imprisoned for no crime
The shackles will be useless
When your life is out of time

Incantation spell gone by
I will see life again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book of red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing, there is no end
I will be reborn

No gift of exile in my fate
I'll get no amnesty
You can't control my destiny
There is no habitual need
Proclaim my death, to end my wrath
It takes more than one try
Indulge your ineffective curse
I will never die

You think by killing me tonight
My powers will not rise
There'll be nowhere for you to run
When my hatred comes to life
Condemned to fill the prophecy
Allowing no first born
Defy your morbid declaration
Leave you ripped and torn

Count your blessing would be priest
As I burn upon the stake
You'd be forgiven endlessly
But your values are all fake
Forever servant of my Lord
By choice and not submission
Maybe now I've made you wonder
Am I superstition

Incantation spell gone by
I will live again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book in red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing there is no end
I will be reborn


Breeding fast in poverty
Infectious driving dormant seed
Inside your carcass start to mate
Left in charge to dominate
Waiting to unfold
Raging uncontrolled
Adapt a potency
Death machine, infest my corpse to be

Unyielding kings of agony
Test your body chemistry
Pulmonary overthrow
Possession of your inner throne
Invasions quickly override, malicious domineering strike
Flood your veins commit slow death
Deteriorate your makers met

Perpetual demise
On a fast decline
Killing tendency
Epidemic, permanent disease

Incapacitate, fall into your fate
Pain results in screams, bleed internally
Years will pass before it can be cured


Funeral held for the depression of man
Holds the key to his own death
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck

Sifting away the debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind

Chanting lines of blind witchery
To save yourself from extinction
Wanting to die is your reason to live
New life born from the oppressed

Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near
Fatality, reality, you await the final call

My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
Come and die with me forever
Share insanity

Do you want to die!

The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death


Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquittance

The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away

Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure
Now I shall reign in blood!


Follow me, I'll lead the way; your fears will soon overtake
Hide your infinite tears inside, it seeks your smallest break
Screaming as if nothing helps, you press on to survive
Playing out the fantasies of a force that keeps you alive

He'll have you down on your knees
You play his fatal game
He'll satisfy your every need
You'll never be the same

Take my hand, I'll show you how;
You've just one life to live
The road you're on goes straight to hell;
Your life is yours to give
His fantasies of all of you are much too great to see
This world your living is so unreal, perfected just for me

He'll have you down on your knees
You play his fatal game
He'll satisfy your every need
You'll never be the same


An unforseen future nestled somewhere in time.
Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs.
Judgment day the second coming arrives.
Before you see the light you must die.

Forgotten children, conform a new faith,
Avidity and lust controlled by hate.
(The) Never ending search for your shattered sanity,
Souls of Damnation in their own reality.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.

Bastard sons begat your cunting daughters,
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers.
Engreat souls condemned for all eternity,
Obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive sabbath.

On and on, south of heaven [x 4]

The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul.
A force that has lived all eternity.
The never ending search for a truth never told.
The loss of all hope and your dignity.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.

On and on, south of heaven [x 4]


Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.

Guidance, it means nothing
In a world of brutal time.

Electric, circus, wild,
Deep in the infants mind.

Silent Scream
Bury the unwanted child.
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn.

Shattered, adolescent [sings: another child]
Bearer of no name.

Restrained, insane games
Suffer the children condemned.

Scattered, remnants of life,
Murder a time to die.

Pain, sufferaged toyed,
Life's little fragments destroyed.

Silent Scream
Crucify the bastard son.
Beaten and torn
Sanctify lives of scorn.

Life preordained
Humanity maintained.
Extraction termination
Pain's agonizing stain.

Embryonic death,
Embedded in your brain.
Suffocation, strangulation,
Death is fucking you insane.

Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.
Innocence withdrawn in fear.
Fires burning can you hear
Cries in the night.


Cascaded darkness
Walls close in on me.
Nailed shut but my eyes still see.
Severe anguish as my body evolves.
The pain of life after death it resolves.

Emptiness in twilight's rebirth,
The faint sounds of shoveled earth.
Madness growing as your mind dissolves.
Merely secret in my dreams.

Night grows cold, twilight's near,
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared.
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
No spared breath.
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode.
Dead soul,
Stone cold,
Out into the night.

Voices inside my head
Hold me under.
Voices oppress.
Like roaring thunder.
An echo bouncing inside my brain.
How much can I take of the pain,
The pain!

A war raging deep inside my head,
A split decision that will end with me dead.

You see the agony in my eyes,
Protruding aimless,
I think it's time to die.

A cannibal's desire feeds the fire
that burns in your head.

Intense pain eats away at your brain,
Thorazine pumping through your veins.

Death walks inside you,
Smell death around you,
Hell's evil spell takes a soul,
Hear the sound of the bell
Counting off death tolls.

Laughing as you eternally rot,
Searching for human flesh
And life's blood.

Live Undead.

Dead


Time melts away in this living inferno,
Trapped by a cause that I once understood.
Feeling a sickness building inside of me,
Who will I really have to answer to.

March on through the rivers of red.
Souls drift, they fill the air.
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.

Do only what is expected of me,
With no emotions my feelings suppressed.
Blind obedience carries me through it all.
Conscience a word I learned to forget.

March on through the rivers of red.
Flesh burns, it fills the air. (Souls drift, they fill...)
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.

Time melts away in this living inferno,
Trapped by a cause that I once understood.
Blind obedience carries me through it all,
Do only what is expected of me.

March on through the rivers of red.
Souls drift, they fill the air.
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.


Murder at your every foot step.
A child's toy sudden death.
Sniper blazes you thru your knees
Falling down can you feel the heat,
Burn!

Ambushed by the spray of lead
Count the bullet holes in your head.
Offspring sent out to cry,
Living mandatory suicide.
Suicide. [x 4]

Holes burn deep in your chest,
Raked by machine gun fire.
Screaming soul sent out to die,
Living mandatory suicide.
Suicide. [x 4]

Lying, dying, screaming in pain.
Begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain.
Mines explode, pain sheers through your brain,
Radical amputation, this is insane.

Fly swatter stakes drive through your chest.
Spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest.
Soldier of misfortune
Hunting with bated breath.

A vile smell, like tasting death.
Dead bodies, dying and wounded
Litter the city streets
Shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit.
Dying [in] terror,
Blood's cheap, it's everywhere.
Mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line.


Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will arise.
Once forgotten soldiers come to life.
Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done,
Not content with wars we never won.

Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn.
Rise ghosts of war.

Target assassinate, time of your life has expired.
Hatred victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die.
Violence inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny
Drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie.

(Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn.
Rise ghosts of war.)

I deal in pain.
All life I drain.
I dominate.
I seal your fate.
I deal in pain.
All life I drain.
Memories can't ignore,
Rise ghost of war.


Evangelist you claim God speaks through you,
Your restless mouth full of lies gains popularity.
You care not for the old that suffer,
When empty pockets cry from hunger.

Penniless from their generosity,
Sharing their money to quench your greed.
Searching for the answer to their prayers
They cry their last wish of need.
Save me.

His spirit lives and breathes in me.
The almighty transformed to your screen.
The meanings lost in its translation,
No holy words, describe his deception.

You say you'll help us find the lord,
Tell me preacher how do you know
A simple quest for a visible savior,
To lead us through our final prayer.
Save me.

Send your donations,
Contribute to the cause.
Luxuries,
Your righteous reward?

Praise the lord, praise god,
Is what you wish to sell.
There is no heaven without a hell.

In your mind's eye could you truly believe,
That by giving you can save your soul,
Could you be so naive!
You heal the sick,[you] raise the dead,
You blind the congregation
With the things you say.

Religious blackmail a deceit of trust,
That death will come and all will be lost.

Can you hear the serpents call,
Look deep in those deceiving eyes.
Ignore the writing on the wall,
You should read between the lies.

When doubt subsides his honesty,
An inquiry, is it blasphemy?
Impure the soul, that's made to suffer,
No sermons left to hide or cover,
An empty promise, lie unfulfilled,
To steal a dream or get it killed.
They claim your trip to heavens nearby,
You may believe it but satan wouldn't lie.


Body that rests before me,
With every dying breath,
Spellbound and gagged,
I commence your flesh to dirt.

Body that lay before me,
In everlasting death.
Entombed in abscess,
To rot and lie stinking in the earth.

Empty altar awaits its victim
Stained glass windows black.
Candles burn the midnight oil,
Incense fills the night.

Observing trance awaking state
Lying still unknowing.
Reciting the passages of time
Prepare for the impaling.

Death's an art, flesh and earth never part,
A power of the mind.
Death shines on the air of silence,
A ritual of endless time.

Purged of your dead body,
Sacrificed of your life.
Unearthly ritual sealed in fire
Enter the kingdom of desire.


Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected to all

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin


Come walk with me through endless time.
See what has been and what the future sees.
Share the wisdom of the old world that has passed,
Step in a life that's yet to be born.

You spill the blood,
Eternal soul.

I'll show you sights that you would not believe.
Experience pleasures thought unobtained.
At one with evil that has ruled before.
Now smell the stench of immortality.

You spill the blood,
Eternal soul.

Spill your blood, let it run on to me,
Take my hand and let go of your life.
Close your eyes and see what is me,
Raise the chalice, embrace for evermore.

You've spilt the blood.
I'll have your soul.


Propaganda death ensemble
Burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night
In blood laced misery
Scorched earth the policy
The reason for the siege
The pendulum it shaves the blade
The strafing air blood raid

Infiltration push reserves
Encircle the front lines
Supreme art of strategy
Playing on the minds
Bombard till submission
Take all to their graves
Indication of triumph
The numbers that are dead

Sport the war, war support
The sport is war, total war
When victory's really massacre
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill

Sport the war, war support
The sport is war, total war
When victory's really survival
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill

Be dead, be from above
When darkness falls
Descend onto my sights
Your fallen walls
Spearhead break through the lines
Flanked all around
Soldiers of attrition
Forward their ground
Regime prophetic age
Old in its time
Flowing veins run on through
Deep in the Rhine
Center of the web
All battles scored
What is our war crimes
(Era forever more...war)

Propaganda war ensemble
Burial to be
Bones shining by the night
In blood laced misery
Campaign of elimination
Twisted psychology
When victory is to survive
And death is defeat

Sport the war, war support
The sport is war, total war
When the end is a slaughter
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill


Peaceful confrontation meet war machine
Seizing all civil liberties
Honest ballotation among banshee
Spilling blood throughout humanity

You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
The massacre of innocent people

Deviated lies fear blinding on your eyes
Enforcing their truth through a gun
Aggressive discipline and barbaric control
Thousands of people cannot be wrong

You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can hide the evil
That stains the primitive sickle

Blood red

Growing opposition with words as ammunition
Expressions of life's liberties
Aggressive discipline and barbaric control
Spilling blood throughout humanity

You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
The massacre of innocent people

Blood Red


Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
As past or present words to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity

[CHORUS]
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the journey's end (Spirit in black till the end)

Spirits damned to rot
Amidst the brimstone fireballs
Eyes of the dead
Watching from their living walls
Broken glass reflections
Show your flesh eaten away
Beyond the gates I'll take you
Where the blood forever rains

Afterlife confessions
Tell me who you used to be
Looking on in wonder
As I show you it was me
Burning from within
You know one spark is all it takes
Hear the piercing cries of all
Who found that hell awaits

Living nightmare can't you see
You really have no choice
Faded memories haunt you
Listen closely to my voice
Feed me all your hatred
Empty all your thoughts to me
I can fill your emptiness
With immortality

Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
As past or present words to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity


Gun down cold on a raw deal
Home turf my battlefield
In no one's way caught in a crossfire
Stray bullets can kill

Expendable youths
Fighting for possession
Having control the principle obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death the only solution

Inured soul lies on the ground
Head blown off face down
Lying in a pool of blood
An accidental death homicide

Struggling to survive
The drug induced warfare
To have control and principle obsession
Expendable youth fighting for possession
Violence is only a friend


How I've waited for you to come.
I've been here all along.
Now that you've arrived.
Please stay a while.
And I promise I won't keep you for long.
I'll keep you forever.

Graze the skin with my finger tips
The brush of dead cold flesh pacifies the means
Provocative images delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control

Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants

In the depths of a mind insane
Fantasy and reality are the same

Graze the skin with my finger tips
The brush of dead warm flesh pacifies the means
Incised members ornaments on my being
Adulating the skin before me

Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants


High velocity bullet at close range
Can damage the mind
Shattering the skull shredding the brain
Severing the spine

Bury a round of lead in the chest
It's quite an impression
Imagine the innards of your soul
The infliction

Instinctive regression
With intent to kill
No regard of human life
Or the blood spilled

Riddled convulsions
Confetti of flesh
Scattered helplessly
Losting your control of physical
Facilities

Release the slide to cleanse inside
Prepare to anoint
Snap the tongue in the groove discharge
To make my hallowed point

The power of a gun
Used with conviction
Disperesed on excursions
Randomly kills its victims

My sweet revenge
Bitter in depression
The thrilling release
Of a hatred deep persuasion

The power of a gun
Used with conviction
Diffused compulsions
Unending repercussions

Violent emotion
Screaming revolution
Spasmic convulsions
Death an empty gun


Minutes seem like days
Since fire ruled the sky
The rich became the beggars
And the fools became the wise
Memories linger in my brain
Of burning from the acid rain
A pain I never have won

Nothing here remains
No future and no past
No one could foresee
The end that came so fast
Hear the prophet make his guess
That paradise lies to the west
So join his quest for the sun

Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be

The world slowly decays
Destruction fills my eyes
Harboring the image
Of a spiraling demise
Burning winds release they fury
Simulating judge and jury
Drifting flurries of pain

Deafening silence reigns
As twilight fills the sky
Eventual supremacy
Daylight waits to die
Darkness always calls my name
A pawn in this recurring game
Humanity going insane

Shades of death are all I see
Skeletons of Society
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be [x2]
Skeletons of Society

Minutes seem like days
Corrosion fills the sky
Morbid dreams of anarchy
Brought judgement in disguise
Memories linger in my brain
Life with nothing more to gain
Perpetual madness remains

Shades of death are all I see
Skeletons of society
Fragments of what used to be
Skeletons of society


Have you ever felt the need
To see more than you can see
Look into uncertainty
Reflections of treachery
Would you leave the world behind
Endless life is here to find
I can interest you in lies
Sell your soul for all it buys

Play with your insanity
Shatter your reality
Pulsing in your blood

I can satisfy your greed
For now all your debts are free
I have all eternity
To quench all the death I breed
Recreate the rules of play
From now things are done my way
None have ever won my game
Crucified them all in flames

Have you ever danced with the devil
His temptation ever summoned you
Ever penned your name in blood
Let possession slowly swallow you
When you stand under full moonlight
The attraction mesmerizes you
Have you ever wondered why
It seems that evil you're attracted to

Reach out to my hand
Step back in time's sand
Genetic wasteland
Far beyond death


Join in my quest to leave life overturned
Spanning the world wave of doom
Spewing out death with the evil I've churned
Awaken the dead from their tombs
Love turns to lust the sensations I've felt
Exploring the pleasures of sin
Making the best of the cards I've been dealth
Adjusting the odds so I win

Unleash all my burning wrath
Potential killing machine
Take down all who block my path
Enjoying all that's obscene... born of fire

Prince of all darkness initiation
Ritually baptized in flames
Next to the throne my abomination
Spreads horror throughout the domain
Master the art that controls the impure
Inherit the infamous keys
Thousands of centuries I will endure
Tyrant of all the prophecies

Some have called me Satan's son
A name I cannot deny
Wielding fury that's second to none
Far to vile to confine... born of fire

All things dead must rise again
When twilight's blanket falls
Splattered red you'll find my den
Blood dripping from the walls

Dreams born of desire
Shaped and forged within the fire
Twisted, warped, deranged I see
The world's corrupt insanity

Dreams possess nightmarish figures
Burning can't escape the embers
Lost are those who trust the Liar
Satan's son I'm born of fire


Razors edge
Outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration

Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane

Innate seed
To watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated eviscerated
Time perpetuated

Inert flesh
A bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals


You know the feeling
When adrenaline takes control
Can't beat the rush
That leaves a suicidal hold

Instinct spares no one
Destroying the human heart
The taste of blood
Can rip your soul apart

Devils that drive us
Do not discriminate
A state of mind
That becomes the ultimate end

Action reaction
Blood line is not immune
To the depth of human nature
Inside of me and you
A sociopath with empty eyes
and no soul
Paranoid psychotic heart of stone
My blood runs cold

Evils of passion
Can drive reason to extremes
Love, hate and murder
Temporary insanity

On the edge of a
Demented personality
Emotional
Pain is a deadly reality

A sociopath with empty eyes
and no soul
Paranoid psychotic heart of stone
My blood runs cold

A choice is made of free will
Just like the choice to kill
Decisions to lose control
My self-destructive rationale

A choice is made, made of free will
Just like the choice, the choice to kill
In the speed of a moment
Life stands still now you're standing in my killing field

A choice is made of free will
Just like the choice to kill
In the speed of a moment
Life stands still now you're standing in my killing field


Caught
Now you're mine
I am the master of your whipping time
The smile
On my lips
The look of horror on your face
Self
Justification
Can't rid the sexual fascination
Can
You deny
My face of pleasure the gleam in my eye

You're nothing
An object of animation
A subjective mannequin
Beaten into submission
Raping again and again

Shackled
My princess
Dangling in distress
Here
To discipline
My sole purpose never ends
Bleeding
On your knees
My satisfaction is what I need
The urge
To take my fist
And violate every oriface

You're nothing
An object of animation
A subjective mannequin
Beaten into submission
Raping again and again

Slaves to my torment
Scream to your heart's content
Time and time again
Pleasure in inflicting pain
Power so insane
Trying to circumvent
Unadulterated battery
Manipulated reality
God is dead - I am alive!


Crisis feeds the lunacy
All fear the new machine
Consumed democracy returns a socialist regime

It's laid to rest without contest
All hail the new incompetence
Making you see what to believe
A drone in the world of anarchy

Treachery, mysery, violence, insanity
Scavengers closing in
Covering the truth again
Castrate society
Fictional reality

Insecurity afraid of things you cannot see
Words become the image of the enemy
You cannot dissect what is correct
Vengeance based on how things are said
Can't see your side - conflicts with mine
Frustrations lead to complete demise

Treachery, mysery, violence, insanity
Scavengers closing in
Covering the truth again
Every trial conspiracy
Compassion is the enemy
Paralyse, criticize
Breaking through the wall of lies

Suicidal hierarchy racing in reverse
Everything that's done today will be tomorrow's curse

Screams in my head preceed your death
Can't hold the rage when the truth is shed
Blind lead the blind line after line
In a world too shallow to defy

Treachery, mysery, violence, insanity
Scavengers closing in
Covering the truth again
Castrate society


This fucking country's lost it's grip
Sub-conscious hold begins to slip
The scales of justice begin to tip

The legal system has no spine
It's corroding from inside
Slap your hand and you'll do no time

Reality on vacation
All across a blinded nation
Mentally under sedation

Anyone can be set free
On a technicality
Explain the law again to me

Here in 1994
Things are different than before
Violence is what we adore

Invitation to the game
Guns and blades and media fame
Every day more of the same

Murder, mayhem, anarchy
Now are all done legally
Mastermind your killing spree

Unafraid of punishment
With a passive government
There's nothing for you to regret

Nothing to regret

Unimposing policy
No enforcing ministry
Gaping with judicial flaws
Watch a fading nation crawl

Clashing with the public's frame
I'm the one that's place in fame
Legislature sets the stage
Social slaves caught in my rage
Administrative anarchy there's nothing
You can do to me
The world around you is drifting to a
Continental tomb you see
Violence is my passion
I will never be contained
Living with aggression and it's
Everlasting reign


Awaken
In a web like Hell
How did I reach this place
Why are they haunting me
I cannot look at God's face

Paralysing
Brilliant light
Trying to run
Want to scream, but cannot speak
I cannot look at God's face

Blind my eyes, I cannot see
What is being done to me
In my mind is only pain
All the memories are drained

Victimized
Specimen
Deathless torture
Void with no mercy
Black shroud blinds those who see

Violated
Naked before you I stand
Shattered shrine of flesh and bone
God's piercing through my soul

Segments of my life
Morbid pieces of reality
Twisted personality
Many faces yet faceless
Familiar things give way to strange
No mercy no reason just pain

Fatal
Sub-conscious control
Threshhold of pain unfolds
Transfixed martyr saving race
Who am I to judge thy grace

Awaken
In a web like Hell
How did I reach this place
Why are they haunting me
I cannot look at God's face

Blind my eyes, I cannot see
What is being done to me
In my mind is only pain
All the memories are drained


Can't explain the other side
Answers lost before their eyes
Violence surges from inside
A state of mind that never dies
Born into a chosen way
Life that doesn't fit today
To die a painful death it seems
Is better than your misery
Contemplating rearranging
Changing all your ways of tinking

Everyday you life seems like
It's pushed into a hole
Acting out another's needs
To rule a soul eternally
Adjusting to another set
Of values takes it's toll
Growing in a lunacy
That plays on your stupidity

Circle of beliefs
Secrets never keep
Living in a lie
Right before your eyes
Born without a brain
Helpless is your name
All you do is pray
Living is your pain

Mentally so small you can't
Accept another side
Your point of view a memory
Because it doesn't mean a thing
The resurrection's waiting for
A world without sin
The temples will crumble
While awaiting for it to begin

Circle of beliefs
Secrets never keep
Living in a lie
Right before your eyes
Losing is your way
Mental disarray
I can see your strain
You don't want to be saved

Can't you see no validity
Must control silencing of souls
Slow decay spreading through your brain
Devistate the deviant will dominate

Can't you see there's no validity
Your way is not the only way
Slow decay spreading through your brain
Don't you see the power of the enemy
Tyrrany total supremacy
Control the silencing of souls
Slavery within the entity
Devistate, dominate

Can't explain the reason why
Someone would rather live than die
If dying is the only way
To end a life of mental stains
All your life he's been the cause
A man impaled upon a cross
Pure religious holocaust
If religion dies it's not my loss

Percertion always biased Feeding off a fallacy
Your systematic way of life
Decided for you every night
Intentional conflicting words
Avoid solidity
Blinded by the holy light
That constantly consumes your mind

Circle of beliefs
Secrets never keep
Living in a lie
Right before your eyes
Burning in my wake
Souls are free to take
You're following a fake
Everyone awake!!!


Ancient crown placed on your head
The hangman of Prague
Seven keys to the chamber
Surrendered to the God

Hunting
Fighting
Killing whore
Wade through blood and bleed some more

Hunting
Fighting
Killing whore
Wade through blood and spill some more

Golden door submits secrets
As this nation falls
Atmosphere of deadly terror
Subservient to all

Hunting
Fighting
Killing whore
Wade through blood and bleed some more

Hunting
Fighting
Killing whore
Wade through blood and spill some more

Burning sense of mission
Assassination
Symbol of oppression

Crusade from exile
Obliteration
Sabotaged campaign

Check resistance from afar
Planning the death of one
When the plot is executed
There will be nowhere to run
Ramafications will be high
A price paid in torment
The end justifies the means
To hell you will be sent

The wolf leader now is the stalked
Expansion state of horror
Guns echo over the grave
A thousand fates are sealed
Murderous power brought to an end
Only to rise again
Cold and ruthless and iron will
Protectorate of the dead

A thorough sweep
Prelude to death
Secrets kept
But no one left
Firing squad
Begins their work
Harsh reprisal
For what you took
Retribution selective terror
The stench of death is everywhere
A severed head
A floating mass
Will give me the answers to what I ask


Let me take you down without a sound
Dead before you hit the ground
Blood washes my hand can't understand
Sterilizing my pain

Washed away with crimson tide
By my hand I keep testing time
Quench the fire that drives my soul
Soothing me as death takes hold

Peaceful and serene slowly bleeding
Eyes once bright are now fading
Pallid ashen face against my skin
Staring blindly at some distant place

Washed away by crimson tide
By my hand I keep testing time
Straight flesh lace adorns your neck
Spilling your blood all over my flesh

Quench the fire that drives my soul
Soothing me as death takes hold
Divine godsend enveloping me
Spiritual ecstasy sets me free


Driving compulsion morbid thoughts come to mind
Sexual release buried deep inside
Complete control of a prized possession
To touch and fondle with no objection
Lonely souls an emptiness fullfilled
Physical pleasure and addictive thrill
An object of perverted reality
An obsession beyond your wildest dreams

Death loves final embrace
Your cool tenderness
Memories keep love alive
Memories will never die

The excitement of dissection is sweet
My skin crawls with orgasmic speed
A lifeless object for my subjection
An obsession beyond your imagination
Primitive instinct a passion for flesh
Primal feeding on the multitudes of death
Sadistic acts a love so true
Absorbingly masticating a part of you

Death loves final embrace
Your cool tenderness
Memories keep love alive
Memories will never die

I need a freind
Please be my companion
I don't want to be
Left alone with my sanity

Erotic sensations tingle my spine
A dead body lying next to mine
Smooth blue black lips
I start salivating as we kiss
Mine forever this sweet death
I cannot forget your soft breaths
Panting excitedly with my hands around your neck

Shades are drawn
No one can see
What I've done
What's become of me
Here I stand
Above all that's been true
How I love
How I love to kill you


Unknown are the caverns of the mind
New realms of affliction lurk inside
Unbound massive mental energy
Your last breaths taken from you easily

Incoherence disrupts your rationale
Involuntary your last confessional
No sense of being missing segments of time
Inconsistency is feeding on your mind

Mind control, pain unfolds
I own all your sensations
Weakening, reasoning
Mesmeric full demolition
Hypnotized - victimized
Behold the threshold to the web
Screaming souls fear echoes
Piercing boundaries of the dead

Penetration of the window to your soul
Deterioration of the mind, no self control
Temporarily comprehend no memories
Hollow carcass of a man is all I leave

Execution but a thought in the end
Slowly erasing your life and what has been
Passing victims in the land of secrecy
Cerebral death can come to you in your dreams


Disintegration you bastard

I've done overdose it doesn't mean shit
One time what about you it doesn't bother me a bit
My body is a weapon and my mind is decay
And all you stupid assholes are here to see me die

Disintegration [6x]

I don't need you now so why don't you go away
Your day will come real soon and your mind will be
And everyone will fuck you, you're such a fucking whore
And when I see you standing there
I just don't want no more

Disintegration [6x]

Free Money

I don't want your problem
Sopping all the time
I can't even go
When I don't even have the time

I want everything and every thing wants me
I want everything and every thing comes out of me

I want free money [4x]

Life is slavery working 9 to 5
Waste your time working
You might as well die

I want everything and every thing wants me
I want everything and every thing comes out of me

Life is slavery working 9 to 5
Waste your time working
You might as well die


What do you expect I'm doing up here
What's with you what's the problem
You will always treat me obscene
Who cares if they make sense

You went and sat there and broke their bottles
You rip the seam off the bottom of their jackets
But you won't even know what are there

You're shit

Verbal abuse
I get into trouble
Verbal abuse
Burn me, I'll do it again
Verbal abuse
It's totally your fault
Verbal abuse
I guess you want some more

Leeches

Listen to her try to suck me dry
Problem with you you're afraid to die
They'll come around again and again
But in the end I know I'll win

There's no preference

Fuck this lets just kill them dead
Fuck with this discussion
Fuck this lets just kill them
Well well what the fuck

The worst thing has been done to you
That dumb ass will blow you away
No one now is getting dead

You won't feel a thing
Or your body's life you were fighting for

Got one now is dead
Got another that makes two
Got one more that is three
Don't cross me no more or you're dead

Problem with you you're afraid to die
They'll come around again and again
But in the end I know I'll win

Fuck this let's just kill them dead
Smash their head
Kill them all
Oh well, oh what, oh once and for all


Abolish government
There's nothing to it
Forget about God
He's no innocent
We live by a system
Of perfect goals
People vs. people who are bored and old

Life must rest on the man who represents

Looking for nothing in this
Campus with just friends
President the name
President the label
The highest man on the government table

Superficial love only for a fuck
But love is incest and it's only for a fuck
To the guys provided free
Peace time war time country's in vein

All die for this land some over seas
I live for the summons serve my country
Army, Navy, Air Force or jail
To the guys provided for free
Peace time war time country's in vein

But that's the American way what it is to be free
If that's what they call freedom it's not for me

President Clinton can suck my motherfuckin' dick


Can't stand -
The way you look
The way you talk
The way you act
Can't stand you

Do I think -
You're a dick - Yeah
You're a fuck - Yeah
We'll fight - Yeah

Do I think you'll win - No

Do I think you're stupid - Yeah
Do I think you're lame - Yeah
Am I stressing
You're the one to blame

I open my mouth at the wrong time
Always ranking on somebody
I'm drunk all the time
Throwing beer bottles and spitting in your face
Checking through the purse
Of the slut in our place

She'll never notice if her money is gone
Piss in her jacket
And just send her along


Swerving through the street
Drunk as fuck
Searching for a open store
I think I'm out of luck
Maybe I'll find a mad mother on patrol

Hit her car
Smash it up
Pull her out
Beat her up
Take her money
Run her down

Can't find any beer
It's way past two
There's just one thing we can do

Hit her car
Smash it up
Pull her out
Beat her up
Take her money
Run her down
Drive her face out of town

Drunk drivers against mad mothers


I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
Lynched somebody
But I didn't know who

You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years before I was born

Guilty of being white [4x]

Guilty of being white [4x]

I'm convicted
Of a racist crime
I've only served
19 years of my life

Guilty of being white [3x]
Guilty of being right


You were just a waste of sperm
They way you look
Makes my stomach turn
The way you think
Is no way at all

God you really think you have balls

I hate you
Ain't it true
I hate you
And everything you do

You walk around like a fucking dick
And everytime you're near
You know I get real sick

You're so stupid
There's nothing in your head
God how I wish that you were dead

I hate you
Ain't it true
I hate you
And everything you do


What happened to you
You're not the same
Something inside your head made a violent change

It's call it religion
You're full of shit

Was she really worth it?
She cost you your life
She'll never leave your side
She's gonna be your wife

It's in yor head [3x]
Filler

You call it romance
You're full of shit

Your brain is clay
What's going on?
You picked up a bible
And now your gone

It's in your head
It's in your head
It's in your head

You call it religion
You're full of shit

You never knew
You never did
You never will

You call it religion
You're full of shit

I Don't Want to Hear It

I don't want to hear it
All you do is talk about you
I don't want to hear it
Cause I know that none of it's true
I don't want to hear it
I'm sick and tired jof all your lies
I don't want to hear it
When are you gonna realize

I don't want to hear it
I know you're full of shit [4x]

Talking everyday
First you're telling stories
Then you're telling lies
When the fuck are you gonna realize

I don't want to hear it
I know you're full of shit [4x]

Ah, shut the fuck up


It's time to be born again
Don't talk about sex that's a sin
Confess yor evils to the man
He'll do everything he can
Don't go mass you'll go to hell
We'll all be there it'll be swell

Pulling your lives
With such lies
Weak don't survive

We're being sucked up
Into the vacuum culture
This way this way
It's too late
Your addicted
Come on control yourself
Snatch that bottle off the shelve

You're trapped now with spiritual law
Spiritual law

Fiddle with your rosaries
Holy water only makes me bleed
Touch that cross to my head
It may burn but I won't be dead

To burn your rosaries
To burn it all
Death to us all

It is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late, you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside Daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

Your hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it
There's one chance left
Get on your knees drink the wine
Chew the wafer

People screaming can I be dreaming
Is this the truth I can't tell
Whether this is heaven or hell
Wolfbane and the sound of a silver bell

The air is thick
The smell of death is everywhere
It's all around
But I won't submit to death
You can go with the

Man don't lie why do they cry [3x]

Ruling your lives
With such lies
Weak won't survive

It is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

You're hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it

It's not too late [2x]

Spiritual law
No way
I want to see Christ today [4x]


Well I'm searching through my bed
I got ankles in my head
I'm in really bad
It's the best time I ever had

I'm a sick boy
I'm a sick boy - there should be more

Well I'm happy the way I am
A sardine in a can
People taking notes
People in white coats

I'm a sick boy
I'm a sick boy - there should be more

Well I'm happy the way I am
And I'm sorry I shit on my hand
People taking notes
People in rubber coats

I'm a sick boy
Just a sick boy
I'm a sick boy

There's assholes everywhere
Plus girls with big town hair
But why must I suffer
For being a fecal lover

I'm a shit boy
I'm a shit boy - there should be more


Will you be the lucky one,
who will see the deadly one?
You will die on your knees,
by the hand of Mr. Freeze.

Will you see when the rest are blind?
Will you remain frozen in time?

Will you flee underground?
Watch the blanket search the ground.
You will die on your knees,
by the hand of Mr. Freeze.

Horror awaits for those who evade.
Ice cold blood, stops in their veins.

Arm yourselves to the "T".
Repel the threat of Mr. Freeze.
See the blood drop in your eyes.
See your family burned alive.

I don't even know you.
I just know where you live.
I've raided your child's bedroom.
Burned his virgin skin.
I'd crucify your nation.
I'll leave your dead to rot.
I'll praise your damaged street.
And bear an iron cross.

The oceans have been ripped away.
It does no good to pray.
All todays cataclysm.
Men restore to cannibalism.

I'm worth all you'd care for,
Then I'll fuck you in the ass.
Oh so fucking happy,
As I kick your face and laugh.
Todays war stories,
At night I can hear you scream.
There's blood on your pillow.
This is no bad dream.
You try to think of reason,
And all you can do is scream!


Forces united the choice is yours [4x]

Violent pacification [2x]

Forces united the choice is yours [4x]

Violent pacification [5x]

We'll force you to be nice to each other
Kill you before you kill each other

Violent pacification [2x]

We'll force you to be nice to each other
Kill you before you kill each other

Violent pacification [repeat till end]

Run on sun


Needles stabbed into the walls
The executioners curtain call
Fighting back he found his identity
And there was no way out

Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With slashing, and stabbing, and maiming and ramming

Death threw his black curtains
Where his clothes once lied
The roof kicked out and the rope tied to the rafters
A quick kick of the chair
And it was all through
If Richie only knew

Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With needles, injecting and shooting subcutaneously

His life suddenly flashed right before his eyes
What a swinging guy
Turning gray with mold
This is when he died

Give it up [x2]
Throw it all away

Burning acid bath
Pulmonary wrath
Feel the boiling surge
It won't let you go

Throw it all away [2x]
Throw it all a....... [2x]
Throw it all away

Swinging in his room
Richie won't come out to play
That poor bastard hung himself the other day
Oh how the years seem to fly by
Is death the final high

'cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With slashing and stabbing and ripping
And stabbing and shredding and slashing
And shredding and stabbing and ripping
And tearing attacking and maiming
And taking the body that god gave to you

I gotta get out

'cause Richard hung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)
'cause Richard swung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)
'cause Richard strung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)
The needle, it stung itself ('cause Richard hung himself)
They pulled him right off the fucking shelf ('cause Richard hung himself)
That poor bastard, man he hung himself ('cause Richard hung himself)

To fucking think of himself


I'm all jacked up
I want you here
In my room I want you dear

And now it's time to bury my face
Between your legs
With my tongue in that special place

Now I'm gonna be your God
Now I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your God

Now I'm ready to close my eyes
To feel that warm deep throat action
Now I'm ready to make you cum
And fuck like dogs all night long

Now I'm gonna be your God
Now I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your fucking God

I'm all jacked up
I want you here
In my room
I want you dear

Now I'm ready to make you cum
And fuck like dogs all night long

I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your fucking God


Endure the pain
You know my name
I am your soul insane

I am no one
No one who cares
I am your soul despair

Your fear deceives
Vulnerability
Leaving an easy prey

Consume your mind
A power so divine
Will take you and rape you blind

Gemini master of demise
Your death is my salvation
To a kingdom mine
My lord is my light
The master of darkness
Your death is my salvation
To a kingdom mine

You look at me with eyes of fate
And see the graphic truth

Your ignorance cannot shield you
From your naked abuse
Numbling of your moral sense
Facing reality
That life is unconditional
And death is only the beginning

The pain will never end...

Walking slow, breathing heavy
You could see death sweat
How it shined
An argument out of control in my mind

I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Walking slow breathing heavy
You can see death sweat.

I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Look into my eyes and see the revelation of your demise
Feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart
Reflections of my soul
Reflections of the dark


Bombers in flight
Trident missiles in the air
My missiles undergroung
Protect us till we're dead

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

Push the button
Kiss good-bye the nuclear arsenal
A bomber flying off their ramps
Nuclear bombs explode

Radio active people
Search for medicine
Pray for shelter
Kill for food

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

Mass starvation
Contaminated water
Destroyed Cities
Mutilated bodies

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

I'll kill myself
I'd rather die
If you could see in the future
You'd know why

Memories of tomorrow


Initiate blood purge
Coalition in massacre
Mechanized high tech
Whole sale death in effect
Mutually assured
Destruction will occur
Genocide revised
Same pain through diverse eyes
Can't stop the warring factions
Hostile from the start
Always war always
Ending bitter peace
Not the last third war
Blood spills for evermore
Patriot hard line
Lay siege till the end of time
No longer kill your brother
Just slaughter one another
Watch for the deadly other
This sibling is a fucker
Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension starts aggression
Peace breaks out then
Breeds contempt unrest

Without a reason to fight
A time to kill
Sick lust for skeletal flesh
A taste for all decay
Enter the soldier blind
Stalking the faceless hunt
There is no conscience in this world
That can be reached for peace
Why face the human question
The need to hate
Dead stare through cynical eyes
A trust in only pain
Murder within the skin
Engrave the art of war
Become death's vile parade
March on embrace the violent mind
Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension starts aggression
Peace breaks out then
Breeds contempt unrest
One cryptic reason for life murder


Death's pointed at your head
Your mind's on the trigger pull it
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story
Scene of your rage
Death is not strange
Blood on the walls
You stand alone satisfied
I'll wake the silence in you
I'll shoot the violence
Terrified by the thought that you are all alone
Paralyzed by the fact that you are not alone
You're losing your mind, I'm losing control
You're losing your mind, as I bury your world
I'll wake the silence in you
I'll shoot the violence
I can't remember yet someone always seems to die
You are the reason why I became the chosen one
I've got the right
God makes no sense
I've got the right
I feel my back against the wall

Death's pointed at your head
Your mind's on the trigger pull it
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story
Scene of my rage
Scene of my rage
Death is your name
You're facing your grave
I taste your tears caress your face
I watch you lie insane
Dying for love
Praying to die
I want what's inside you
Dressed in your blood
You wear it well
Dying because I care
Your eyes are wide but you can't see
Rotting my lust away
I'll shoot the violence through you
And wake the part that's dead
I hate the silence in you
I want what's in your head


Imagine Humanity's decline
Step inside my stain of mind
Infesting superiority
Infectious immorality oh yea
Come worship the place no truths are told
Praise the land where sins are sold
No passion no love your faith evades
Never see yourself again that way
Death becomes your bride
Lifelessness invades your eyes
In fire baptized
All pain sifts through myu soul
You'll never feel greater misery
Master of my enemy
Let the purest stain of mind
Wash the virtue from your eyes
As one the collective unifies
Emanate a faithless shine
Forever creation has conceived
Birth of destruction spreads its wings oh yea
Chaotic rebirth a new domain
Re-live the sight the sound the pain
Erotic the taste of agony
Adorn the scars of inhumanity
This is what you see
Deep inside of me
Agony is life
Lechery is life
Godlessness is life
Purgatory magnified
In fire baptized
All pain sifts through my soul
You'll never feel greater misery
Master of my enemy
Let the purest stain of mind
Wash the virtue from your eyes
Enticing malevolence allures
Bastardize the clean and pure
Salvation forever crucified
I choose the other side oh yea
Entire, complete serenity
Injected intravenously
Transgression euphoric bliss divine
Initiate a timeless stain of mind
Blood will sterilize
In fire I baptized
All pain sifts through my soul
You'll never feel greater misery
Master of my enemy
Let the purest stain of mind
Wash the virtue from your eyes


I breach your life
Indoctrinate
Police your thoughts
Ask why I hate
I lose control
When I see your face
Abusing power
I infiltrate
Continue lies
Then masturbate
I walk the line
I'll do no time
I hate your church
I'll burn your state
A bleeding heart
A seal of fate
There is no crime
Within my mind
I'll sell your life and preach your death
A wicked plan born of contempt
Bleeding my ideology through pain

Audacious plans
I calculate
A new world view
I'll re-instate
Don't cross my path
Or I'll see you burn
You'll meet your end
Find death alone
No grave to mark
The seds you've sown
You've pushed too far
My secrets I defend
I'll sell your life and preach your death
A wicked plan born of contempt
Bleeding my ideology through pain

Demonize what is feared profane architect
Skull and bones through the mind
Barbaric thoughts of old
Celebrate all unknown
At last the dead await
The die is cast for the meek
Inherit endless dead time
Smell the victims are near
consume the catalyst
Hunting masses for game
implanting septic thoughts
Reaping terror through words while
armed behind your back
Pseudo leaders betray
enslaving all of mankind
Cast out the Demi God
Dethrone the demagogue
Cast out the church God
I command your life
And I don't care
Let bullets rain
From everywhere
No suicide
Will save you from yourself


You better learn my name
Cause I'm the one insane
And I'm a constant threat
You run in fear from my dark silhouette
Inside my violent mind
Chaos is all you'll find
Anarchy uncontained
Bear witness to the scorn of my campaign
Perversions of pain
Seep from my eyes
Into your brain
Visualize
Within my world of hate
Disruption I instate
Malicious entity
Defile and desecrate humanity
Alone they all will die
Corroding from inside
With no one left to save them
As I'm dancing on their fucking graves
Perversions of pain
Seep from my eyes
Into your brain
Visualize


Take a look into my mind
Where pleasure is refined
Endless burning holes
Of scarred souls
Step inside my world of hate
Where everything mutates
Your senses under siege
Ingest the virtues I feed
A higher level of pain
Is racing through my veins
There's nothing more intense
Than mental misery that I dispense
So follow right along
Observe a fresh new dawn
Of super sensation
My realm of torture stimulation
Perversions of pain
Seep from my eyes
Into your brain
Visualize
You better learn my name
Cause I'm the one insane
Inside my violent mind
Chaos is all you'll find
Within my world of hate
Disruption I instate
Alone they all will die
Corroding from inside
Follow right along
Observe a fresh new dawn
Racing through my veins
A higher level of pain
Higher level of pain
Higher level of pain


Enter my mind can you stop the rage
No one shall mourn or pity my grave
Fighting the world without remorse
Searching for blood to never grow old
A personal hell is where I reside
Taunting death sounds cadavers in pain
Judging my soul I am not his son
Screaming God's name I want some more
You love to hate me
But you won't kill me
Suicidal surge
Desensitize the world
Take what I want primordial ground
Humanity bleeds from inside my veins
Losing all grasp an evil so old
Vengeance it breeds driving you insane
Exhaust all will hanging by the neck
Anguish within let it blind the eys
Better off dead is your epitaph
Apathy feeds the human demise
Absolute reign a malevolent mind
Conceptions so vile in this bottomless soul
Shooting up hate nothing beats the rush
Total addicting, corrupt and profane
Force-fed lies in this chapel of lust
Dancing in blood disciples enslaved
Putrefied walls adorned with your flesh
Coating this shrine of the ungodly cross
You love to hate me
But you won't kill me
Suicidal surge
Desensitize the world

Pessimistic dreams
Realistic screams
Crucify creation
Magnify damnation
Enter my mind can you stop the rage
No one shall mourn or pity my grave
Fighting the world without remorse
Searching for blood to never grow old
Putrefied walls adorned with your flesh
Coating this shrine of the ungodly cross
You love to hate me
But you won't kill me
Suicidal surge
Desensitize the world


No one could ever doubt my rapture
As you too wil son discover
No one will ever cross my love
Deadly consequence will rise above
Lying all alone
Visions of erotic bliss
Feel your warmth from inside your skin
A fever I can not resist
Desire I would kill for you
Right or wrong I'd do anything
True and pure the intensity
Every time death is next to me
Lying all alone
Visions of erotic bliss
Feel your warmth from inside your skin
A fever I can not resist

Anxiously feeling grotesque
Up against your flesh
Forbidden fantasies
Uncontrollable heat
Find yourself all alone and dead
Visions of corroding bliss
Feel the warmth from inside your skin
A sensation I can't resist


I want to
Invite you
Welcome you
To my hate
To my scorn
To myself
Saturate you
Infest you
Betray you
Stimulate you
So eager for my lies

For my lies... Lies

Lies in the name of God

I take you
I play you
Invade you
Lacerate you
I scar your
Innocence
Masticate you
Ingest you
Become you
Defenseless
I fill your emptiness

With my lies... Lies

Lies in the name of God
In this world of shit I exist
Perfect world conforms I resist
Disconnect the nerves from the spine
Desecrate the walls of the mind
Through these eyes no love is alive
Through these eyes unrest never dies
Through these lies compassion is lost
Through these lies await the Ungod
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God


No blood no glory
All pain and fury
A demonstration
Of domination
Show of pure intimidation

Full contact why I live and breathe
Side stepping all the human debris
Head strong I know that I'll prevail
Face down in my arena you will fail
Head to head eye to eye
Human pile of proven pride
Ripping flesh spitting teeth
Sacrifice for victory
Base line Goal line
Overtime Killing time
Relentless brotherhood of discipline
Centuries of tradition is to win
Head first into battle feel the rush
Living on adrenaline your try is crushed

No blood No glory
All pain And fury
Head to head eye to eye
Human pile of proven pride
Ripping flesh spitting teeth
Sacrifice for victory
Base line Goal line
Overtime Killing time


I stalk close in from above
Silent wings will test your faith
Death will never hear me pass
Launch attack you're too late
I hear flak inside my head
Deafening thunder cities burn
Carpet-bombing laid to waste
Throwned inside a death mask
Holy cross embedded in your tomb
Casualities are buried through your mind
Certain death is screaming from the sky
I live to destroy below
Hunted victims are unseen
Flying wrath a fortress hell
War machine to kill all
I leave carnage in my wake
Choking bleeding for your life
Faceless prey has been erased
Silence reigns you're dead now
Holy cross embedded in your tomb
Casualities are buried through your mind
Certain death is screaming from the sky

Listen to the rhythm of a dead man walking
Silent is the heartbeat of the predator stalking
Hear the sound of air feel the warmth touch your neck
Reality is not fair no time to second guess
Hear the distant ringing of the blade as it cuts your neck
Silent is the cry lying on your mattress of blood
An easy mark for a veteran of execution
I walk step by step with death
Where all bludgeoned bodies lie
You will see my face of rage
Cut your heart out of your chest
Leave impaled the consummation of mankind


Cataract blinding your eyes
To the violent design
Regenerating impending genocide
It's the dawn of decay
Mark the end of your days
Just another lost casualty of the times

The wicked will feed the chaos
Control and rule disorder
Disintegration's multiplying
Till there is no more bloodline
A future of neverending
Insane civil disorder
Free yourself from the red dawn
The time has come

Death's head shattering
Blow to the throat
At the end of the rope
Degeneration that follows into the fire
In a world gone insane
No one else left to blame
Your just another part of the collective vile

The wicked will feed the chaos
Control and rule disorder
Disintegration's multiplying
Till there is no more bloodline
A future of neverending
Insane civil disorder
Free yourself from the red dawn
The time is now

Era of total destruction has slowly begun
Yielding death none will survive
Order out of chaos the true will of the Beast
A life of desolation

Ten bleeding heats
One wicked mind
In spiritual sin
Their time is now

Era of total destruction has slowly begun
Yielding death none will survive
Order out of chaos the true will of the Beast
A life of desolation

Ten bleeding heats
One wicked mind
In spiritual sin
Their time is now

Famine, plagues, war and death
scourges preceding the end
Death is your only savior

Ten bleeding heats
One wicked mind
In spiritual sin
Their time is now
Bringing total annihilation


I'm the one that brings you war
Infiltrate unguarded shores
Master of afflicting pain
Point is where all die

I'm the one to taste your blood
Trashing through the crimson mud
Messenger of all demise
Point is where I reign
Piercing, impaling, no judgement, just punishment
Discreate, annihilate assault with no regret
I'm the one to taste your death
Basking in your dying breath
Messenger of all demise
Point is where all die
Piercing, impaling, no judgement, just punishment
Discreate, annihilate assault with no regret
Born to kill sweep and clear
taring down the face of fear
Shrapnel flies dehumanize
Flesh and blood will ferilize
Empty all the magazines
Lethal spray form M-16's
Pace the march and sing the song
Right the fuck where I belong
Stained in blood
No fear - no sound
Penetrate your holy ground
Leave you where your comrades lie
Point is where all die
Pure destruction has begun
Fearlessly the battle's won
Spread extinction through the dawn
Signature of wrath is spawned
Minister of death unreleased
My lust for war will never cease
With no remorse I watch you die
Body count's the bottom line
Crashing slashing to the end
Your final pulse has just been spent
Leave you where your comrades lie
Point is where all fucking die

Crashing slashing to the end
Your final pulse has just been spent
Leave you where your comrades lie
Stained in blood
No fear - no pain - no life

Clouded skies rain only death
Silence all opposing threats
Quench the hunger of my gun
Exploding cites overrun
I'm the one to taste your death
Basking in your dying breath
Messenger of all demise
Point is where all die


Use the need, lose control,
Hidden voice inviting,
Imposing will, unconscious skill
Embraced immoral passion.
Born is still, thirst for thrill,
Indulgence of illusion.
Neurotic, psychotic,
Dead silent screams, come alive.

Killing seed, first degree,
I shut the world outside.
Denied and laid to waste,
The body and soul divide.

A final thrill, a timely kill
Unbound, unguarded.
Fantasized, realized,
Enforced upon the dying.
Free reign of the asylum,
Archaic energy thrives,
Dead cold, I control
Eternal screams that slowly die.

Killing spree, first degree.
I shut the world outside.
Denied and laid to waste,
The body and soul divide.

Dimentia born of sin,
A symptom that begins,
Vengeance so divine.

Lost my grip of what's real.
Unrestrained self-induced vertigo.
Manic power chills my spine.
I can't erase this instinct I embrace.

Two faced moral abandon,
Races my blood boils my skin.
Unhinging the doorway to this asylum,
Releasing unshackled poison dreams.
Beginning the end of temptation.
A vengeance so divine.
The end of temptation,
A vengeance so divine.

Killing spree, first degree,
I shut the world outside.
Denied and laid to waste,
The body and soul divide.


Mankind in his insatiable search for divine
Knowledge has discarded all biblical teachings

Realizing that the strength of religion is the repression of
knowledge
All structures of religion have collapsed

Life prays for death
in the wake of the horror of these revelations

It was never imagined how graphic the reality that would
be known as the end
of creation
Would manifest itself

We believe all this chaos and atrocity can be traced
Back to one single event

We hold these truths to be painfully self-evident
All men are not created equal
Only the strong will prosper
Only the strong will conquer
Only in the darkness of Christ have I realized
God Hates Us All


Drones since the dawn of time
Compelled to live your sheltered lives
Not once has anyone ever seen
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy
I'll instigate I'll free your mind
I'll show you what I've known all this time

God Hates Us All, God Hates Us All
You know it's true God hates this place
You know it's true he hates this race

Homicide-Suicide
Hate heals, you should try it sometime
Strive for Peace with acts of war
The beauty of death we all adore
I have no faith distracting me
I know why your prayers will never be answered

God Hates Us All; God Hates Us All
He Fuckin' hates me

Pessimist, Terrorist targeting the next mark
Global chaos feeding on hysteria
Cut throat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back fair game
Drug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high
Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
I'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies

I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow

Man made virus infecting the world
Self-destruct human time bomb
What if there is no God would you think the fuckin' same
Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
Wake the fuck up can't ignore what I say
I got my own philosophy

I hate everyone equally
You can't tear that out of me
No segregation -separation
Just me in my world of enemies

I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow
I'll never be the one to bear the cross-disciple

I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place


On your back look on to me
You'll see genocide
Face from death more than insane
Profane pleading cries
Watch you die inside watch you die

God send death end misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin a shattered faith
Down on your knees
Your screaming out to die

Death is over due
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me

Putrid blood flows through my veins
To thrive on demise
Voyeurs' lust watching the pain
Touching you inside
Bleed you fucking dry
Bleed on me

Death's design blood splattered wall
Face melting one vicious whore
Twisted figures flesh from bone
Down on your knees
Your screaming out
To die

Death is overdue
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me

Clawing at the eyes of god
You taste your death in hand
Your fingers bleed in vain
Your scream-in your grave
Clawing at the eyes of god
You pierce your throat and hands
You've gone insane with pain
Your blind screaming for your god
Pathetic god

Death's design blood splattered wall
Face melting one vicious whore
Twisted figures
Drown your mind in pain


Holy man open up your eyes
To the ways of the world you've been so blind
As the walls of religion come crashing down
How's the ignorance taste the second time around

Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins

Welcome to the horror of the revelation
Tell me what you think of your savior now
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times
I won't be force fed prophecies
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind
Join the new faith for the celebration
Cult of new faith fuels the devastation

Holy man come and worship me
I am all that you ever wanted to be
I'm the life of indulgence you never knew
The epitome of evil shining through

Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins

Welcome to the horror of the revelation
Tell me what you think of your savior now
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times
I won't be force fed prophecies
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind
I keep the bible in a pool of blood
So that none of its lies can affect me

This is new faith
A different way of life
Witness the shame
See for yourself the lies
I'll take the fight
Bring it every time, any time
Refuse to let them win
My heresy begins

Pray for life - wish for death
Pray for life - know in time you'll pray for death

Tear it away
It lives inside your mind
Silence the fear
That keeps you pure inside
Now you can see
Life's atrocities endlessly
Witness the miracle
Witness the miracle

Pray for life - wish for death
Pray for life - with every breath
You'll pray for death - you'll pray for death
Embrace new faith, embrace new faith
Yeah, new faith - yeah, new faith.


Despair, emptiness
See the hatred wasted on yourself
Face down taste the dust; it's getting harder everyday
Just to find a reason not to end it all yourself
Suicide on the street
Everywhere around you watch it breed
It begins to bury you in self-induced rejection

So now you're wasted, broken down
I see through your ignorance
Penetrate the surface of your insecure inside
Next fix, shoot it up
Looking for the place where god speaks
Every time you find him he just stabs you in the back
again

No one hears you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you

Cast down and thrown away
You are the living dead
The needle numbs the pain
Of all your suffering
This is where the world of money changes nothing

Just a statistic in the shadows of the real world
The system's failing you just the way it failed me
Hell is home on the concrete where the city bleeds
America - home of the free - land of fucking
disenchantment

Despair, emptiness
Isolation rapes you everyday
Face down taste the dust, digging deeper in your grave
Haven't found a reason
Haven't found a thing to fucking live for
Godless he doesn't care
How you choose to destroy yourself
In a world that feeds on hate
You're left here just to waste away
In your cardboard prison, asphalt wasteland

No one hears you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you
No one sees you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you

Cast down and thrown away
You are the living dead
The needle numbs the pain
Of all your suffering
This is where the world of money changes nothing


I don't want to see, I don't want to hear
I don't want to feel anything Can't you understand
Everything I do doesn't stem from you
It doesn't have a fucking thing to do with you
I just want to die Throw it all away
Never have to feel again the way you make me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me
Take It
I can't control the rage that flows from me
I can't shut it down it overwhelms me
I can't stop the rage that flows from me
Can't Stop The
Violence I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else You're In my way
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate there is no other way
It's my discipline it's my way of life

Never wanted bliss never wanted you
Never needed anyone I've polluted
Everything you feel everything you are
Everything you'll ever be you repulse me
It's always about you always come at me
With shit I can't identify you know it makes me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me
Take It
Can't stop the
Violence I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else you're in my way
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate there is no other way
It's my discipline it's my way of life


Even though some things are better left unsaid
There's a few things I need to get off my chest
I need to vent - let me tell you why

I'm suicidal, maniacal, self-destructive
You leave me no hope, no life
Nothing worth living for
I've taken it, can't take it anymore
My worst nightmare
You make me want to slit my own fucking throat
Just so I'll be rid of you
Just to get rid of you

You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart
out
My hate is contagious; you've got no one to run to
EXILE

Just tell me fucking why everything becomes an issue
Your opinion is always senseless - fuck this
You make my fucking skin crawl
I've lived with it - can't stand anymore
My worst nightmare
I want to take a bullet in the fucking head
Every time I think of you, every time I think of you

You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart
out
My hate is contagious
Anyone else need to vent?
You've tried my tolerance; I just want you to die

There's nothing more for me to say
There's nothing more for you to say
There's nothing more for us to say
I fucking hate you anyway
EXILE

Can't count the ways that you light my fuckin fuse
I can't tolerate the sight of you, the thought of you or
anything about you
You know what I want to see?
How many ways can a loser fucking lose
I know you'll find a way
The humility awakening the idiot inside
You spineless fucking maggot - you're just wasting my
time
Get out of my face - Get out of my life
Out of my fucking way - Just die


I saw them all around today
They don't stop they won't go away
They love the darkness in my eyes
Help me find a way out when I'm lost within myself

They show me everything I need
There's nothing wrong with a little greed
Never enough to satisfy
Such a driving desire that burns inside

My life came with it's own scars
I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow
I can't say I've seen it all
But I live for the things that keep me hollow

Everyday I look into the mirror
Staring back I look less familiar
I've seen all seven faces
Each one looks a lot like me

They all look like me
I never see them coming
But they show me more of myself
Drawn into the depths
I never knew existed
Launching me face first
Into the pleasures of pure lust and greed
I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess
I want it all more pain more sex more lies more of
everything

My Life came with it's own scars
I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow
I can't say I've seen it all
But I live for the things that keep me hollow

Everyday I look into the mirror
Staring back I look less familiar
I've seen all seven faces
Each one looks a lot like me

They all look like me

I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess
I want it all more pain more sex more lies more of
everything


Eternal the kiss I breath
Siphon your blood to me
Feel my wounds of your god
Forever rape mortality
I smell of death
I reek of hate
I will live forever
Lost child pay the dead
Bleeding screams of silence
In my veins your eternity

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth

First breath born come alive learn to kill
Bloodfest awaits to feed your hunger
Dark side has no rival test your faith in blood
Night hides the hunting packs a feeding frenzy

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth

I am the first not the last
Condemned by a single kiss
Betrayed eternally I'll rip inside your soul
Contaminating the world
Defying god and son
Black heart that brings your death
Living in infamy

Drink the flesh of life itself
Prepare to reign a thousand years

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth

Blame god chosen children
As you die I'm immortal
Faithless no religion
Stalking prey is my confession
Captive blood enslavement
Pain and hunger drives your madness
Drink flesh life itself
Prepare to reign a thousand years


I embrace the darkness within
Forever serve beneath its hand
Horrid thoughts that surface to me
Ceremony bloods command
I will live through this forever
I have done the things you grieve
As you kneel before its evil
Death is here deep inside your

Skinned alive now naked
Terrorized no humanity
Seek salvation from an mia god
Empty vessels chanting for your death

Walk the streets beneath the shadows
Searching for a cryptic bride
Eat alive the conscience I hate
Without pain I watch you die
I will live through this forever
I have done the things you grieve
As you kneel before its evil
My face is the last you'll see

Soaked in blood the mask you wear
Haunting cries the dead scream for me
Staring eyes invoke no guilt
I can taste your mind your lifeless

Face the dead and dying
Feel your life drain
Through your soul
Seek salvation from an mia god
Empty vessels chanting for the dead

Death is yours
Your veins have dried
Staring eyes of glass now empty
Still you speak with lips so cold
In my head I hear you cry

God is dead can't save me
Taking lives with impunity
Resurrection of a deviant Christ
Feeding hate to capacity - deviance


Explosive you feel the impact hit your face
What makes you think I'll let you survive
You want a war I'm the front line
Unbroken

This ain't about me
I'm better than you'll ever be
You don't concern me
I know you'll never get to me
You want a shot
I can take your best bring it on
Get ready for the pain
Cause this where it's going down

Warzone- This is where it's going down
Warzone- When you walk in my world
Madness is coming your way
As long as my heart still beats
I can guarantee you
Madness is coming your way

Survival here is thrust upon you
Fuel the fire bring another victim
Take your lesson in Supremacy
Cause I'm the one who stands alone at the summit

This ain't about me
I'm better than you'll ever be
You don't concern me
You know you'll never get to me
You want a shot
I can take your best bring it on
Get ready for the pain
Cause this is where it's going down

I am the wall you can never climb
I am the pain that you feel inside
I bring it all let the show begin
I am the War you can never win

Warzone- This is where it's going down
Warzone- When you walk in my world
Madness is coming your way
As long as my heart still beats
I can guarantee you
Madness is coming your way


I am the new hell on earth
The lord of agony divine
Domination, intimidation
Lives within these eyes
Reign of power
Remorseless anarchy
I am arrogance in the flesh
Unleashed intensity

Step aside for the nightmare
Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho
Brings you misery
The line starts here

I am brutality the face of everlasting pain
Annihilation, Obliteration
Pulses in these veins
Sheer defiance drives my hostility
I am merciless to the core
Chaotic fury breeds

Step aside for the nightmare
Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho
Brings you misery
The line starts here

Bring it all on
Come and take on what you fear
I'm the storm
That towers overhead
Ticking time bomb
With an infinite charge
Bringer of torture
The master is here
Everyone falls

Here comes the pain
You're no different from the rest
Victim is your name in my vicious wasteland
Here comes the pain
Your destruction manifests
Lying there broken looking up as I still stand

Bring it all on
Come and take on what you fear
I'm the storm
That towers overhead
Ticking time bomb
With an infinite charge
Bringer of torture
The master is here
Everyone falls


You need to take a closer look at me
Cause I was born to be the thorn in your side
No matter what you think you're gonna see
You never wanted this barrage of fucking pride
You don't want none of me

You've got a fucking catheter in your brain
Pissing your common sense away
When you draw first blood you can't stop this fight
For my own peace of mind - I'm going to
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall - now you're nothing
Payback's a bitch motherfucker

You only live to be a parasite
Your life must suck when nothing's going your way
Everything melts away before your eyes
You're just a punk that doesn't have the sense to get away
Get the fuck away

You've got a fucking catheter in your brain
Pissing your common sense away
When you draw first blood you can't stop this fight
For my own peace of mind - I'm going to
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall - now you're nothing
Payback's a bitch motherfucker

I will never become your fucking scapegoat
I don't know how it feels to come up short
I only want vengeance
To come shining down on me
I don't want you to die
Before I get the chance to kill you myself

You've got a fucking catheter in your brain
Pissing your common sense away
This is for the mindfuck
This is for the hell of it
This is for me- I'm going to
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall - now you're nothing

Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall - now you're nothing
Now you're nothing

You ain't fucking shit


Come step inside my hate, you know there's nothing to it
Step inside my pain, you'll never make it through it.
Once you're sucked into my sado-paradise
Lose your mind, inside, the pleasure lies within your pain.
Pain.

Drown in my hate. You know, you know.
Brutality's the way of this world.
Branded and scarred. Defy, defy.
A comatose and blind existence.
Hatred holocaust you see in me
Is more than just a way of life.
I've reinvented the way I relate to this complacent world.

All of life decays.
Rapes my eyes.
Screams never silence the pain.
Death is like an old friend.
I can't wait to watch you die.

I am you vice. So real, so real.
Desires of the scars of new flesh.
Bathe in you blood. Excites, excites.
The ritualistic lacerations.
Inhumanities. Profane, insane
Inflicted since the dawn of time.
Make your peace with God. Goodbye.
And embrace the pain that burns inside you.

All of life decays.
Rapes my eyes.
Screams never silence the pain.
Death is like an old friend.
I can't wait to watch you die.
I can't wait...

Come step inside my hate, you know there's nothing to it.
Step inside my pain, you'll never make it through it.
Redefine your life in sado-paradise.
Necessary cleansing of the mind's eye.
Love and agony. Electric ecstasy.
Can't get enough euphoric serenity.
Stains won't fade away forever scarstruck.
They never fade away forever scarstruck.

Drown in my hate. You know, you know.
Brutality's the way of this world.
Branded and scarred. Defy, defy.
A comatose and blind existence.
You're like the walking dead. So blind inside.
Oblivious to psycho pleasure.
I am your new God. Un-God.
So if you want hell, here I am.

Everything around me decays.
Rapes my eyes.
Screams never silence the pain.
Make you my canvas of pure, fresh flesh
Scarstruck!
Scarstruck!
Scarstruck!


I won't cover you eyes
I want your innocence
Glisten before me in a cold sweat
I wan't you to see your lie spill on me
Spill on me
Manifested as a primitive craving
The craving never seems to go away
I want to see the face of everyone fall
Fall into the cold embrace of death
You're in my nightmare
I decide when it stops
It's my fucking drug
Makes my rush intensify
Hardcore the overdose
Your fear gets me high
Unbound I'm the weapon made to sterilize
Sterilize all the idiot victims
Anytime, anywhere, anyone I want
Everyone's addicted to this torture
I'm the agony in every breath
Every breath brings you closer to me
You'll do anything, anything
You'll do anything to make it stop
You're in my nightmare
I decide when it stops
It's my fucking drug
Makes my rush intensify
Chaos deep inside it makes me
It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill
It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill
Do you want to feel eternity
Your eternity lies within me
I am the terror of your final breath
Your final breath brings light to my darkness
Like an act of fucking God unleashed
On the innocence - innocence of mankind
You'll do anything - anything
You'll do anything to make it stop
It's my fucking drug
Makes my rush intensify
Hardcore the overdose
Your fear gets me of like fuck
