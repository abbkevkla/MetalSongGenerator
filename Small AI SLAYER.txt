You never wanted to be here
You've never felt this way
You've never felt this way

I am alive, I am going to be forever
I want everything, I want what's inside of me
Everything I need right here in this fucking world
I want everything, I want what's in my head


Imagine fucking it

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in
