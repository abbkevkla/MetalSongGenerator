Bastardize the clean, common ground
A bloodscales prophet
The first step to hell is not to try
But to learn how

There's no preference
Just kill and kill again
There's no preference
Just kill and kill again


Take a look into my mind
Where pleasure is refined
Endless burning holes
Of scarred souls

I'll kill you and your dreams
I'll get you where you need to be
But don't die just follow
Cause I'm the one who left
There's no preference
Just kill and kill again
There's no preference
Just kill and kill again


I walk the streets of this dead world
Look into the eyes of the dead
Chaotic changes must be watching me
See for myself
Unbound I'm the new normal
Erotic ecstasy surges my sensations
See for myself
Unbound I'm the new normal

High velocity bullet at close range
Pistol free your toy death
In seconds bullets kill
My sweet death
Proclaim my death
Contains pentobarbital

Multi use capacity
5x the price
All your pain will be spent
