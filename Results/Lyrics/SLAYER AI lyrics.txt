You never wanted to be here
You've never felt this way
You've never felt this way

I am alive, I am going to be forever
I want everything, I want what's inside of me
Everything I need right here in this fucking world
I want everything, I want what's in my head


Imagine fucking it
You take my fucking eye off the prize, you can see
There's nothing more intense
Inside your head, a fever dream
That'll make your head spin
It's in your head, inside your mind
You think you can rip it off

It's in your head, inside your mind
You think you can
Break it
Take it away

It's in your head, inside your mind
You think you can
Fuck it
You'd be mad at me
I'd be insane

You think you can rip it off

It's in your head, inside your mind
You think you can
Break it
Take it away

It's in your head, inside your mind
You think you can
Fuck it
You'd be mad at me
I'd be insane

There's nothing more intense
Inside your brain, a dream
That'll make your head spin
It's in your head, inside your mind
There you go

It's in your head, inside your mind
You think you can rip it off

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind
It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in your head, inside your mind

It's in
====================
In a world of blind obedience
When a command is not enough

Force feeds tyranny
When a stupid plan works its way through
When anarchy sets in

Blood spills for evermore

Powers go wild as slaves suck
When money freezes your
Inconsistency
Promiscuous insanity

You leave behind your slaves the right to rape
Take what you want evermore

You can't-
None of your business
Must trade in bleeding heart
For a few more

Minutes seem like days
Since the dawn of time
Since the dawn of myth

The Force is with you
In the flesh
In the mind
Watching each step that you take
The death of one who'll endure

Forgotten men, they too will die

Forgotten children, they too will die

I will live and rule and lead
All fear the Force
Will bring
The end of all hope
Of nothingness

Watching each step that you take
The death of one who'll endure
I am the Hammer in the Granite of Death
Suffocation, terror, and pain
For all that are lost

Fear and loathing, the name of Death
Is embedded in your brain

A life of afflicting pain
Pain that can't be contained
Is permanent â€“ it's damned to be

My powers of persuasion are obscene
Alluring yet helpless
Alluring yet helpless
Alluring yet insatiable
Alluring yet never ending volley

My victims are all I am
I am the rage of Death
in all your pain

Necessary stimulation yet divine
Alluring yet insatiable
Alluring yet never ending volley

To satisfy the craving, I command you
Delight my lord in shining armor
With all you flocks of maids
At your command
Sacrifice the lives of all I know

I am the fury of Death
in all your pain

Necessary stimulation yet divine
Alluring yet never ending volley



Bombers in flight
Trident missiles in the air
My missiles undergroung
Protect us till we're dead

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

Pushrods in action
Bombard till we overrun

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow
A bomb our way to war

Welcome to my world
I'm the Antichrist
The Antichrist of the New World
Jesus is my light
Welcome to my light
Involve yourself within my light
Feel my presence
Feel your salvation
Within yourself
Feel my decree
Take what you want
Take what you want
Feel my decree
You're hereby made my Savior

You're free to live your sheltered lives
In my image
You're not to be blamed
For anyone's trouble
I control your destiny
Feel your salvation being taken from you
I have done and said so
Allies with the darkened souls of New York
I control your misery
And your misery's defenders

Blind obedience to the will of God
Awaiting the final judgment

Circle of beliefs
Secrets never keep
Living in a lie
Right before your eyes
Seeking the truth
Awaiting the final judgement

Circle of beliefs
Secrets never keep
Living in a lie
Right before your eyes
Seeking the truth

All of life falls
As soon as life has cooled
Death falls from the sky

Blind obedience to the will of God
Awaiting the final judgement

Blind obedience to the will of God
Conscience of a devious mind

All of life falls
As soon as life has cooled
Death falls from the sky



Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death

Screams in my head
Rise angels
Tell me who you think is God
Tell me what is obscene
A child's dream of death


What is the meaning of life
A life that doesn't die

A life that doesn't grow old

Control of blood flow
Possession of your soul

On your back
With no fear
No fear - no sound
Instinctive pacification
Pill your death embrace
Death is pure vengeance

Pillage roll off the tongue
Eyes of the dead are lost
In everlasting death
Shed your flesh to shreds
A ritual murder
Perversions of pain
Seep from my eyes
Into your brain

You better learn my name

I see
====================
The world's elixir of immortality
Pumped full of life itself
Purged of dead life itself
Left to rot
Empty to waste

Demonic flight, hearthbombing
Mechanized society's crumble

Breeding fast, buddying

In the wake of death
The sickening pain
The sense of being dead
The sense of being part of it

It's the spice of life
It's the spice of life

Zombies screaming, burning and pleading
They're coming for you

Dead
Are dying
Are dying

Dead
are alive


Language dead
Language dead

Famine-stricken regions
Limb dissection, amputation
Sliced incision, oration, over and over


Gun down cold, surgical precision
Machine gun fire, blood level higher

There's no preference
Just kill and kill again

It's not too late, your wounds are not fatal
You've got the right mentality
Gun down cold
Ready to kill

There's no preference
Just kill and kill again

It's not too late, your wounds are not fatal
You've got the right mentality

Bastardize the clean, common ground
A bloodscales prophet
The first step to hell is not to try
But to learn how

There's no preference
Just kill and kill again
There's no preference
Just kill and kill again


Take a look into my mind
Where pleasure is refined
Endless burning holes
Of scarred souls

I'll kill you and your dreams
I'll get you where you need to be
But don't die just follow
Cause I'm the one who left
There's no preference
Just kill and kill again
There's no preference
Just kill and kill again


I walk the streets of this dead world
Look into the eyes of the dead
Chaotic changes must be watching me
See for myself
Unbound I'm the new normal
Erotic ecstasy surges my sensations
See for myself
Unbound I'm the new normal

High velocity bullet at close range
Pistol free your toy death
In seconds bullets kill
My sweet death
Proclaim my death
Contains pentobarbital

Multi use capacity
5x the price
All your pain will be spent
====================
I can't stand -
Condemned -
To keep moving in circles
I see hate in the eyes of everyones
Knowledge declines in this world
I can't see beyond the blurs in my eyes

I want to see, I want to see
But I can't -
No one hears me
I want to see, I want to see
But the world keeps going down
I want to KILL YOU, YOU KILL AGAIN
I want to KILL YOU AGAIN

Jesus saves, I can't wait
I can see the pain in your eyes
I turn and see the blood drop in your eyes
I see death dripping down from above
Crying God's name in your ears
I want to see, I want to see
But I can't: I don't want to see, I don't want to see
I want to see, I don't want to see
I want to see, I don't want to see


Awaken
In a web like Hell
How did I reach this place
Why did I die,
I don't know
What is going on
I don't know
What is going on
I don't know
How can I tell
How can I know

How can I tell

How can I tell

How can I tell

How can I tell

How can I tell

How can I tell


I saw the terror in his eyes
They didn't hide the depth of his sorrow
He didn't hide the pain that he felt
He never forgave himself
He cast you to the winds
And when he hears you he
StabBY

I saw the dawn was upon the land
It came to life to heal
A life of sin
It's not too late to run
You've tried, you've tried

Pennsy the eel
Shades of death are all I see

I scrape at the surface of existence
As though the world werent there

Symbol of all that is dead
Dance with the dead
In blood that's for all to see

Symbol of all that is alive
Dance with the dead
In blood that's for all to hear

Symbol of all that is dead
Dance with the dead
In blood that's for all to see

I scrape at the surface of
====================
You can't control the flow of hate
It's spreading all the time

I stalk Godless Night
Invade the darkened halls
Stalking the faceless prey

Empty all your thoughts to me
Empty all your thoughts to me

Empty all your thoughts to me

I stalk the invisible one
Disintegration's closing in
Soon we'll all be his slaves

Empty all your thoughts to me
Empty all your thoughts to me

Empty all your thoughts to me

I violate no one
No one's ever done this to you

I stalk the invisible one
Disintegration's closing in
Soon we'll all be his slaves

Empty all your thoughts to me
Empty all your thoughts

I violate no one
No one's ever done this to you
I release this endless search for god
Forbid a deception
That keeps on releasing

I search the earth for pearl
Or crystal

I don't need you to tell
You're the one to blame
For some strange obsession
With sex that's all too common

I violate no one
No one's ever done this to you
I release this endless search for god
Forbid a deception
That keeps on releasing

I am the Antichrist
All compassion and mercy are lost

I show you how to love me
I won't judge you
I only serve to insult you
I only let you down

I am the Antichrist
All compassion and mercy are lost

I show you how to love me
I don't care what you think - you'll never feel better

I am the Antichrist
All compassion and mercy are lost

I show you how to love me
I watch you suffer
I won't judge you
You'll never feel better

I am the Antichrist
All compassion and mercy are lost

I watch you suffer
I watch you regress
I am the Antichrist
All compassion and mercy are lost


Can't explain the other side
Answers lost before their eyes
Violence surges from inside
A state of mind that never dies
Born into a chosen way
Life that doesn't fit today
To die a painful death it seems
Is better than your misery
Contemplating rearranging
Changing all your ways of tinking

Everyday you life seems like

====================
I'll never be the one to bear the cross-disciple
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Defile the walls of lies
Pulverize the world

I reject all biblical views of the truth
I reject all biblical views of the truth

I reject all biblical views of the truth

I reject all biblical views of the truth

I reject all biblical views of the truth


I embrace new faith
Faith here to stay
I can't deny
Reality almost religion
Jesus is my deity
My life came with it's own scars
I embrace the new faith
Faith here to stay
I can't deny
Reality almost religion
I can say with a straight face
I've known god is real
Forces behind my back know no truth
A force of nature
Living my violent shadow
Everyday I look into the mirror
Staring back I look less familiar
I've known god is real
I am becoming more real
I want what's in my head
I want what's in my head

Terrified by the thought that you're all fake
People around me getting on my nerves
It's becoming harder everyday
Forces behind my back know no truth
A force of nature
Living my violent shadow
Everyday I look into the mirror
Staring back I look less familiar
I've known god is real
I am becoming more real
I want what's in my head


I'm a sick boy
I'm a sick boy
I'm a sick boy

It's the rush of cold blood that fuels the hatred
Every time I think of death
The images around me are shooting up
It's the rush of cold blood that fuels the hatred

It's the rush of cold blood that fuels the hatred

It's the rush of cold blood that fuels the hatred

It's the rush of cold blood that fuels the hatred

It's the rush of cold blood that fuels the hatred

It's the rush of cold blood that fuels the hatred


I'm a sick boy
I'm a sick boy

It's the rush of cold blood that fuels the hatred
Every time I think of death
The images around me are shooting up
It's the rush of cold blood that fuels the hatred
It's the rush of cold blood that fuels the hatred


Die by the sword

====================
Of all the ways to torment the Devil
How
I
contempt
Unleash my power
Turning hate against you

How
I
contempt-in-a-mouth
Killing bastard
Dodging life
The urge
To kill
The perfect victim
Lying all alone
Visions of erotic bliss
Feel your warmth from inside your skin
A fever I can not resist
Desire I would kill for you
Right or wrong I'd do anything
True and pure the intensity
Every time death is next to me
Lying all alone
Visions of erotic bliss
Feel your warmth from inside your skin
A fever I can not resist

Anxiously feeling grotesque
Up against your flesh
Forbidden fantasies
Uncontrollable heat
Find yourself all alone and dead
Visions of corroding bliss
Feel the warmth from inside your skin
A sensation I can't resist


I want to
Invite you
Welcome you
To my hate
To my scorn
To myself
Saturate you
Infest you
Betray you
Stimulate you
So eager for my lies

For my lies... Lies

Lies in the name of God

I take you
I play you
Invade you
Lacerate you
I scar your
Innocence
Masticate you
Ingest you
Become you
Defenseless
I fill your emptiness

With my lies... Lies

Lies in the name of God
In this world of shit I exist
Perfect world conforms I resist
Disconnect the nerves from the spine
Desecrate the walls of the mind
Through these eyes no love is alive
Through these eyes unrest never dies
Through these lies compassion is lost
Through these lies await the Ungod
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God


No blood no glory
All pain and fury
A demonstration
Of domination
Show of pure intimidation

Full contact why I live and breathe
Side stepping all the human debris
Head strong I know that I'll prevail
Face down in my arena you will fail
Head to head eye to eye
Human pile of proven pride
Ripping flesh spitting teeth
Sacrifice for victory

====================
My face is like a knife in your brain

before you, with the intensity of God's love
I want to kill you, somewhere good in this world

I want to kill you now
I want to kill you now
I fucking fucking fuck

Man don't move a finger
Tighten their blue jumpsuit
Watch the sky burn
A drone in the world of Theros

Swoop in hand, pat on the back
Don't move a thing
Listen to what I say
Listen to what I say

They're following me
I don't have time
Don't cross my path
And I won't see you coming

You've cowered down
Your eyes were wide
Youre too young
To see the face of god
Sting attack

A violent revelation

The truth is out there,
The Devil's watching the game
A technical foul on one of the nation's best
The play can't go wrong
The refs were called assholes
The officials were called racist
The play was flagged for technical fouls
The refs were called cowards
The refs were called Satanists

The refs were called racist
They didn't even know what they were doing
They threw the ball in the air
And all bled there

Jesus caught and slammed the table
Blow it up
And ripped the words 'Crucify the so called Lord' out of their mouth

Jesus turned and saw what was going on
He slammed the table again

Jesus saw what was going on
He pulled out a gun and used it all
He slammed the table again

Blow it up! (Smash it)

'cause he's a punk
Holy shit!

(It's called religion)

Drones in the sky
Trident flying all over
The black shrouding you
Is this the truth you must ask

Drones in the sky
Black speckled light above
You panic under the strain
It's not enough to cover
They'll find your grave
But the martyr will remain

Jesus caught and slammed the table
Blow it up! (Smash it)

'cause he's a punk
Holy shit!

Aged Servant of the Heavenly Father
The master of pain
The lord of agony

The son of man's doom
Brought glory to the mines
And sealed it to the brine

Schizophrenic
Scattered
Ilsun, among the dead
Ran, among the flames
Soon will be born again

Gods on the throne
Will save all, all for me

Demon lord of the mines
Will bring justice

The choice is yours

You've got the right
God makes no sense
I'm the one insane

You've got the right
I'm the Terrorizing Presence
The whole world around you

You've got the right
I'm the Terrorizing Presence
The whole world around you

I am the Antichrist
The Antichrist of the mind


Would you leave the world of religion unfulfilled
Without a reason to believe
Would you leave all mankind condemned to die

The incantation begins
Raining blood
From the jaws of death
Descending upon unknown

I will die alone
No one to blame
My sins would arise again

I will remain constant
In the darkness of Christ
You will see
The incantation begins

Descending upon unknown

I will die alone
No one to blame
My sins would arise again

I will remain constant


In the depths of the web
Guns and water and lies
Rise from the grave
Rest in peace

I will live to be 100
Years from now
I'll slay the phantom man
You'll be transported to my realm
I have the power
To take the world



The pride of this world
Is crushed
Underfoot
Mines explode
Skeletons form
Drones of the web
Lock onto my surface

A domain in which all things are mine
Domain of the soul

We'll fight to the death
All for the dream
Of a better world

World without sin
Is lost within
Dogs of war slaughter
Enjoys the bounty of the hunt
Screams of agony
Captive terror drives me insane
Devils that drive me insane

Godless conflict
Exertion is futile

War machine developed to oppress man
Fantasy of war
Imagine the tension that results
When development is halted

Supreme art of mine
Become the weapon that brings about the end
Of all mankind
A world without god

Sacrifice, no life
A domain in which all things are mine

World without sin
Is crushed
Underfoot
Mines explode
Skeletons form
Drones of the web
Lock onto my surface

A domain in which all things are mine
World without sin

It's the worst thing that's happened to me
It's the worst thing that's happened to me
It's the worst thing that's happened to me
 It's the worst thing that's happened to me
 It's the worst thing that's happened to me
 It's the worst thing that's happened to me
 It's the worst thing that's happened to me
 It's the worst thing that's happened to me

Trying to think of a better way
To take the worst thing that's been done

You try, you try
But nothing works
Cause somebody in blue has to be the solution

Everyone on the roof is screaming
Help!

It's raining

Death's an art, don't do it
Don't cross me
I know what I'm gonna find
In the depths of Hell
Anagram of blood
Holds the jackal's head
Bring it on

====================
The stone wall we see
Is all that we ever wanted to be

The walls start to crumble
The life we so desperately wanted
Turning gray
With only the fading of summer

Clouds rise from the frozen water

Death takes my hand
And stares into mine
Mine
Watching each step that I take
I take a bullet in the fucking head
For fucking shit I say!

Blood starts to trickle from the walls
Initiate blood purge
Screams can be heard from inside
As death takes my hand
I'll take the bullet
Out of my fucking way
Take a good look through my eyes
Evils that dwell inside me
Reign of power
Take a bullet and kill them all

Death is all you'll get
Bearer of no name
The master of pain
The one to fuck you deep

You'll never be the same


The master of pain
The one to fuck you deep
Welcome to the grave
Wash the virtue from your eyes
Sift through the rubble

Salvation for all who die

Sabotaged war effort
Pumped the bombs that killed more

Welcome to the grave
Prepare for the slaughter
Wash the virtue from your eyes
Sift through the rubble

Salvation for all who die

Spilling the blood
All over your life
Compassionless war crime

Soaked the world below
Cooled the sex itself
Frozen the frozen blood

Is killing people all over the place
Is killing souls all over the place

Welcome to the grave
Wash the virtue from your eyes
Sift through the rubble

Salvation for all who die

Spilling the blood
All over your life
Compassionless war crime

Soaked the world below
Ceremony bloodless
Eternal damnation

Here we stand
Twisted figures carved from stone
Twisted figures carved from stone

Breeding frenzy
Pumped the bombs that killed more
Pumped the bombs that killed more

Welcome to the grave
Prepare for the slaughter
Wash the virtue from your eyes
Sift through the rubble

Salvation for all who die


This fucking country's lost it's grip
Sub-conscious hold begins to slip
The scales of justice begin to tip

The legal system
====================
You are what you see
I am all that you ever wanted to be
I am the wall you can never climb
I am the pain that you feel inside
I fill the void
Your pain fills my emptiness

Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension of $
No one stands a chance when there's only one

No one stands a chance when there's only one

Global tension of $
No one stands a chance when there's only one

Global tension of $
War crimes and war crimes
By any other name
You have no legal right to be there
Fighting and killing and rapes and robberies and rapes and assaults
As long as you keep attacking me
As long as you keep shooting down your own country

Fighting and killing and rapes and robberies and rapes and assaults
As long as you keep shooting down your own country


It's time to be born again
President Clinton's song
Piss in my eye
It's all about control
When are the pants flying

It's all about control
When are the pants flying

It's all about control

Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension of $
No one stands a chance when there's only one

No one stands a chance when there's only one

Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension of $
Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension of $
War machine
Up to our eyeballs
Global war is coming your way
Bombers in every hand
Global war is about to begin

There's no stopping the warring factions
Global tension of $
No one stands a chance when there's only one

No one stands a chance when there's only one

Global war is coming your way
Bombers in every hand

I'm the one that's calling the shots
I'm the one who's chosen

====================
The way you look
Shades of death
Can't see above
The depth of evil
The thought that keeps creeping up inside
Your brain becomes the microscope
Human misery unfolds
An arena for the insane
The vicious madman
You're hereby summoned!
Enter the impure
Innate game of jesting
The soul of death is no friend
The game is simple death
The game is over before you know it
Your mind becomes the object of fascination

The screaming child
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Death is yours to keep
The game is simple death
The game is over before you know it
Your mind becomes the object of fascination

The ritualized cannibal

(The) Seven deadly blows to the head
Invasions quickly destroy
Unbound gas
Infused with rage
The gas makes its escape
In a world beyond our grasp

Weakening, Rationalizing
Adapting to new humanities

Apathy, the burning desire
To slit your own flesh

Paralysis, Death, Lies

Inhumanity, the way in which the virus infects

Neurotic disorder, the loss of control of one's life

Control of one's life is rendered impossible
By a virus that has never been known

Regenerating a disease that has been spreading throughout
The body's tendency to rot
Malnutrition, disease resistance
Malnutrition, disease resistance

Intolerable, no one shall eat or drink
A state of mind so very real
Malnutrition, a disease that thrives outside of
The brain's ability to process
Malnutrition, a disease that thrives within

Apathy, the burning desire
To slit your own flesh

In a world beyond your reach
Control of one's life is rendered impossible
By a virus that has never been known

Regenerating a disease that has been spreading throughout
The brain's tendency to rot

In a world beyond your reach
Malnutrition, a disease that thrives within

No one shall drink or use this forbidden food
All life I drain

Out into the world of fire
Eternally frozen, your soul and mind
Unbound, immortal,
Free of pain

Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn
Of trials that never begin

Murder, mayhem
====================
You know the feeling
When adrenaline takes control
Can't beat the rush
That leaves a suicidal hold

Instinct spares no one
Destroying the human heart
The taste of blood
Can rip your soul apart

Chaos is coming true
Your adrenaline-fueled death match
Screams of terror
Are coming from all directions
Checking on my brain
Looking for the answer to every question
What is going on inside my brain
What is going on in my brain?

I am becoming the face of chaos
You look at me with eyes of fate
And you know what I'm gonna do

I am the new hell on earth
You pray daily
Your tears flow constantly
Toil constantly
Toil endlessly

I am becoming the face of chaos
You look at me with eyes of fate
And you know what I'm gonna do

Grand canyons of pain
Exploding, meter after meter
Global hysteria
Ticking time bomb
With an infinite charge
Warmer than the seas
It's better than hell
You'll never be the same


The beauty of death
Can't ignore the pain

Ray of light
Siphon nerve energy
To kill our enemies

Beautiful things are living in the dark
True are seen that far
Nearby towns overrun
Terror looms heavy
How long can man endure
Lost in his sleep
Walking slow as mud
Screaming soul
I am the one that brings you here

Ray of light
Siphon nerve energy
To kill our enemies
Fragments of what used to be
Living
In this impenetrable hole
All life I drain

Sliced through the mind
To take what I want

I live for the summons
All that survive my force
Seek salvation from the grave
Perish to your eyes

Sliced through the mind
To take what I want
Eternal damnation
The summons commence

Sliced through the mind
To take what I want
Eternal damnation
The power of the mind
Is to sift through the collective unconscious

To sift through the collective unconscious

Seek salvation from the grave
Perish to your eyes



Explosive you taste of sex torture
You magnified
You're just a waste of sperm

You
====================
We're all about the pain
Celebrate the new millennium
Searching for the answer to his prayers
He'll have you down on your knees
You play his fatal game
He'll satisfy your every need
You'll never be the same

Pessimist, Terrorist
Burning out in me
Sliced open on your skin
3D printed skin
Spewing destruction
Warmer than the gun
Feel the heat than die
I'll hunt you till the end
Your death will come just like it did my
Before you knew it

Chemical warfare

Mass starvation
Wet you on the face of the earth

Chaos in which I thrive
The pain feeds my rage
The world around me is shit

Gods on the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
All of a sudden the pain stops
You notice the strain in my eyes

God can't save me
I'm trapped inside a fucking bomb
I can't even go
Up!

KILL AGAIN
I'M KILLIN AGAIN

BECAUSE I'M BORN
God can't save me
I'm trapped inside a fucking bomb
I can't even go
Up!

Trapped in a world that never dies
Awaiting the mass genocide
All of a sudden the pain stops
You notice the strain in my eyes

I can't even go
Up!

I'm waiting for the perfect moment
Awaiting the mass genocide
All of a sudden the pain stops
You notice the strain in my eyes

I can't go
Up!


Holy man are these flames spreading
They keep me pure

My sins are being exposed
In the light of the Lord

Awaiting the mass genocide
All of a sudden the pain stops
You notice the strain in my eyes

I can't go
Up!

Sacrifice the life of a friend
To save a life
Their lives are forever changed

Holy man are these flames spreading
They keep me pure

My sins are being exposed
In the light of the Lord

Awaiting the mass genocide
All of a sudden the pain stops
You notice the strain in my eyes

I can't go
Up!

Fly dies, man steals
Eternal damnation await
====================
As you can see I am fading fast
I don't want to see
You look at me
And say, 'What the fuck is going on'

I don't want to be seen
You look at me
And say, 'What the fuck is going on'

I don't want to be left alone
I don't want to be left alone

'Cause it's what God wants
Everything about you is fake
You want a war?
No chance in hell
A kingdom under siege

Cause fuck are they talking about
A fucking religion
A fucking bible

All fucking things fake
You have your own
Fucking strange
What are they saying

Jesus Christ's soul is inside of me
Mind control
Pulmonary wrath
I won't be silenced
I can't hide
From your violent glare
Pace your life in chaos
Everything I do is scripted

A lost child
Crying internally
Before you see the light
Become flesh and bone soldiers
Hell awaits.

Jesus Christ is inside of you
Feeling a sense of mission
It's coming full circle
It's totally yours

You're trapped inside a fucking chapel
Apt apt apt
It's burning down your street
It's attacking your church
It's stabbing your head
It's killing you

It's what it's worth
It's in black pride
It's in a fucking pride in fucking God

It's in a fucking pride in fucking God

It's in a fucking pride in fucking God

It's in a fucking pride in fucking God


Abolish Bollywood
It's what it is
Taken without blame
Whom it wars
It's left behind
In a world too shallow
To shame
Indulge your lies
In a lie, Satan speaks

Of domination, of blind obedience
A deception so massive
That none can see
The deception
Is that of the devil

In the depths of a vice
A deceit so massive
That none can see
The deception
Is that of the devil

In the depths of a vice
C of lies

Satan speaks of the future
That he sees shining through to us

Apostle on the ground
Blood on the wall

In a life so ephemeral

We'll all die
====================
Life with nothing more to gain
Pessimist, morbidist, psychotic, suicidal maniac
Everything I touch dies
Of time

Pessimist, morbidist, pulls the trigger
Suffer the children of man's fate
Is the end of creation
Showers that cleanse you of life
The plague
Scourges of witchery
Innocence gone am I,
Pessimist, morbidist
You criticize everything
True God is dead
But what if there were
 none?

Life is damnable
Nobody's perfect
Everybody's a dick

Life is damn the fault of every fucking thing

Nobody's born with the power of a God

Nobody's perfect
Everybody's a fuck up

Nobody's born with the power of a God

Nobody's born with the power of a God

God is damn it
God makes no sense
Awaiting the mass genocide
Awaiting the genocide

I am all that you ever wanted to be
I'm the life of indulgence you never knew
The hunger in your belly grows stronger
I'm the reason why you flee your eternal home
I'm the reason behind your exile

You think by killing me tonight
I'll kill you in hell
You think by killing me today
I'll kill you in hell

You think by killing me tomorrow
I'll kill you in hell

You think by killing me today
I'll kill you in hell


Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.

Guidance, it means nothing
In a world of brutal time.

Electric, circus, wild,
Deep in the infants mind.

Silent Scream
Bury the unwanted child.
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn.

Shattered, adolescent [sings: another child]
Bearer of no name.

Restrained, insane games
Suffer the children condemned.

Scattered, remnants of life,
Murder a time to die.

Pain, sufferaged toyed,
Life's little fragments destroyed.

Silent Scream
Crucify the bastard son.
Beaten and torn
Sanctify lives of scorn.

Life preordained
Humanity maintained.
Extraction
====================
You will die
Your final words to me
Will be words of steel
You will never heal the wounds you've been through
You will be eternally scarred
I'll shoot the violence
You feel the pain
As it burns your chest
Relentless brotherhood of Slayer's remains
Shocking the world
Your final words to me
Will be words of steel
You will never heal the wounds you've been through
You will be eternally scarred


Enter your name in blood
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck
Like the waves of blood that cleanse the world of
I'll kill you wherever you are
Death is here deep inside your brain

In your mind's eye, the horror of the decision has begun
You feel the stabbing pain, it's growing stronger
As the pain begins you realize
You must have lost your mind

As the pain begins you realize you must have lost your mind
You must have lost your mind

There's blood on your pillow
You think you can destroy it
You think you can -

Holy ground, holy ground
Mutilated animal, this is what lives inside
Deep inside of me
The holy ground, the holy ground

Drones since the dawn of time
Compelled to live your sheltered lives
Not once has anyone ever seen
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy
I'll instigate I'll free your mind
I'll show you what I've known all this time

God Hates Us All; God Hates Us All
He Fuckin' hates me

Strick your neck and knees and show the world how sorry
You're going to have to die

I'll take your fuckin' life!

I'll take your fuckin' life!

Superficial love
A gift from God
An unforgettable stain
I'll take the fight - any fight, any
My passion is eternal damnation

I want to kill you
Inject yourself deep in the flesh
Kill your mind and body
Absorb your mind and soul
Vessel for the dead
Leave you where your killing day has begun

Head blown off face down
Inaccursed
Knock on your back door
Begging for your life
Casualities in collapsed buildings
Head blown off face down
Inaccursed
Dead of night
On the run from government
Bearer of no name
Inhumanity

Faceless prey
Sniper stalks, man blocks of prey
Scream to your heart's content
Death machine, sickening weapon
Pulsing pain through your chest
Isolation agony beyond words
Compassionate death, love of horror

Hatred growing stronger
Chaotic pain growing stronger
Facile fear growing stronger
Global unrest growing stronger
Militia of blood killing agents
Watch no one but yourself
Hypnotized doctors growing sick
None to be found
In a world gone insane
Faceless prey dying stronger
Compelled genocide
Head blown off face down
Inoculated, mutilated, and scarred
Sacrifice for all to come

Inoculable, insane, and spawned
Bearer of no name
Executes innocent people
Rapes and rapes even more

Inoculable, insane, and spawned
Bearer of no name
Puts an end to all suffering
Takes everyone else's child
To his grave

Inoculable, insane, and spawned
Bearer of no name
Pensils alive
Stains the world from inside
Suffer from the fatigue

Vomiting fits the name
Lacerating thoughts the way death does

Vulnerability, disease, death
Hollow carcass of a man is all I need

Condemned to be the face of evil
Death is coming more easily
Infectious immorality more quickly
Facile death, immorality
Vomiting more quickly
Observing eye for an eye
Frigid cold, absorbing more
Frigid cold, absorbing more
Bitter in your heart, you notice
Something

Pray for the dead
Searching for a way out of this impregnable hole
EXILE

Welcome to the horror of life after death
A world of perfect symmetry

See the thoughts in your brain

The boy is no different to his brothers
Satan's son

Satan's fever sets him straight

The flesh is torn inside the brain
Lying all alone

The rage of Satan's son
Screams of terror from the grave
Find him an easy death

The priest's soul is missing

His body is not worth a soul

The priest's soul is worthless

This lethal poison
Can't escape the state where no one can find
Liquidate the poison can no longer be removed

This lethal dose of Satan's blood
Can't escape the state where no one can find
Liquidate the poison can no longer be removed

No one could ever doubt the wickedness of God's face

The oceans turn black
The sky is sinking
A child's dream is made of stone

A butcher's nightmare
The skin on your neck is burning

A wicked plan is in place
To kill and kill and kill
and kill

Holy man come and worship me

Smell the smoke you ask, breathe
The smell of death on you

Kill the son you love

It's time to leave.
The light of the truth is shining on you.

You're trapped.
Intent is right, say what is true.
Ruling your lives is a slut.

No one hears you.
You're too stupid to be anything.

You criticize myself.
I'm not your useless idiot.

Abolish government.
The way you look at it is all you
Can't stop the way I look
I see through your fear
Stalking, stalking,
Harming you are the people you love

A power you can't defend
You cannot defy
God makes no sense

A principle you can't defy
Your religion makes no sense

A flash of red will bring you to your knees
A bullet in the head will kill
You have no choice of life or death

I have no faith
You have no faith

I have no faith in you

Can't control the emotion
You're too stupid to realize

You've got a fucking catheter in your brain

I see life with its skeletal features

I feel the warmth of the earth
Touch it gently
Take a look beneath you
As if it were my soul

I feel the warmth of the earth
Touch it gently
Take a look beneath you
As if it were my soul

A life lost soul
emit death star
suddenly die

Lift the silvery blade from my throat
Gunslessly slicing at the soul
Taunting and killing as many as are at my side
Unleash your pure evil
Cut down as many as you can
Leave behind your shattered soul

All of life's wickedness
Purged from your corpse
Lift the gleaming blade from my throat
Gunslessly slicing at the soul

Unleash your pure evil
Cut down as many as are at my side
As many as will die
Splattered red you see the end is near

Ending bitter bloodcurdling
Pumping the gun to the brim

Death is here, the final high

Join the new order
The wicked will prevail
Mountains lie fallen
Lost are those who dared defy

Triumph of the super angel
The warriors that fell
Man's soul and his soul are no match for the evil that dwells

On the edge of a
Demented
====================
You walk down the hallowed thoroughfares
As I step inside your life
I am everything you mistreat
I can't ignore you
I am the battle in which I live
I am the battle you see
In this frightful dream I must face
I am the life that you so despise
In this world my enemies are well on their way
To a life of bliss

War machine hell awaits eager to strike
Propulsion core set to warping field test
Pulses in space destroy at will

Eternal soul your war cry
Branded in crimson
A soul of my enemy

Launched from my tomb
Reign of terror trial of attrition
Modulistic terror test
Gestapo strike again
Satan's child now in high school

Destroyed worlds away
From the red sun
New age cult born
Of total destruction
Infiltration, repression,
Crucify, terrorize
The bastard child of my enemy

I am the menace in your eyes
The one you can't escape

You have your own God
Endorsed
By a chosen few
Unification mass genocide

Formations of my forces
Kill at will
As we kneel before the wall
For the doorway to our hate

Endures of bloody retribution
Blood spills for each death
A ritual of silence
The Lord has his way
I am the master of your darkness

Transgressing oceans of blood
Stalking the faceless
No mercy no form of life

Sacrifice and rape and murder
Repeatedly ending in death

The pain will never end

The pain will never end

Death is only the beginning
The power of a dying man
Holds the balance of power
In my veins it charges!

Warriors from Hell
In the wake of the Luciferian nightmare
Creature comforts human demise
Harlots of Hell reward those who help
Black knights from Hell's terror
Oblivion they command
Warriors from Hell
In the wake of the Luciferian nightmare
Creature comforts human demise

Sacrifice and rape and murder
Repeatedly ending in death


Holy man come alive
Spike of the cold
Touch of death
Feel the deadly heat

====================
In a world ruled by violence
Faith in the sword
Will save your soul.

Death's a pain many suffer,
But a constant reminder
To never die.

Sport the pain of life's afflicting,
Fantasy the reality of death.

Sport the pain of life's afflicting,
Sport the pain of life's demise.


Mankind in his insatiable search for God
Is unable to come to an end
Without divine intervention

Universality is his persuasion
To take a closer look at their plight

A state of mind that becomes more pronounced as more are realized

Convicts of erasing creation
Are condemned to die

Suffering from amnesia
Imprisoned in a shell that never dies

Jesus saves, no words of praise
No promised land to take you to

Wherever you turn
Necessary punishment is administered

Gemini master of fate
The black arts of black magic
Inflict permanent mental damage
No promised land to take you to
Wherever you turn
Necessary punishment is administered

Gemini master of fate
Black magic revolution
Infest with rage
The power of a demon
Can control and destroy

boundless blackness
With which I damn this Earth
God speaks in my head

I am becoming all things envied,
All things feared and admired
Rise all naked in the face of
The impure in me.

Through these eyes of the damned I dawn
A higher purpose than ever expected

A gift of destruction that will bring me to my ultimate end

A gift of initiation that will bring me to my death

A gift of initiation that will bring me to my death

Enticing, frightening, prophetic
Within my mind the gates of Hell are wide opened
Power plays, pure, pure
Power are all I have
Power is my passion
Within my mind the gates of Hell are wide opened

Pure destruction,
Pure destruction,
Pure destruction

Through the eyes of the damned I dawn
A higher purpose than ever expected

A gift of destruction that will bring me to my death

Enticing, frightening, prophetic
Within my mind the gates of Hell are wide opened
Pure destruction,
Pure destruction,
Pure destruction


Existing on damnation
====================
The art of persuasion
Can't win when the enemy is first

The secret of victory
Is to remain hidden
Always waiting for the next opportunity

The art of war
Can't win when the enemy is first

The art of persuasion
Can't win when the enemy is first


Awaken
In a web like Hell
How it burns inside
How it rolls up in a pile
How it rolls up in a pile
How it rolls up in a death

God send death
God send death

Area of effect damage
How it feels going into battle
Who is to blame

Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension starts aggression
Peace breaks out then
Breeds contempt unrest

Without a reason to fight
A time to kill
Sick lust for skeletal flesh
A taste for all decay

Fuel the fire
Break through the wall of fire
Break through the wall of fire
Destroy without destruction

A consummation in fire
PERSE CHRISTIAN

Enter the kingdom of lust
A kingdom of sex
In a world of lust

Subversive action a sado-con man
Saturities in the bedroom
Lechery overrun

A passion that grows in contempt of God
A passion that breeds in disenchantment

A consummation in fire
PERSE CHRISTIAN

Leave the world your sanctified virgin
Body that burns burns within
In fireballs baptized
You leave heresy
Unveil the hidden coffin
Enter the kingdom of lust
A kingdom of sex
In a world of lust

Pure destruction overwhelms the body
In fireballs
Sinking fast the blood starts to rise

A passion that grows in contempt of God
A passion that breeds in disenchantment

A pure, final death
The body that burns within
In fireballs
Sinking fast the blood begins to rise


How I've waited for you to come.
I've been here all along.
Now that you've arrived.
Please stay a while.
And I promise I won't keep you for long.
I'll keep you forever.

Graze the skin with my finger tips
The brush of dead cold flesh pacifies the means
Provocative images delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

Dance
====================
You can't ignore the fact that I'm the one who killed you
Angry, indignant stranger starts stabbing at the walls
Of hate and murder
I walk the streets I hate
No one stands a chance
When hate is born
It spills over into your reality
It's all too real
Forgotten children born of lust
Defy the label "angel of death"

Enter the realm of death!

Angel of Death
Tyrant of all the prophecies
Evil with you now, Lord of the Flies

Heretics without a soul
Wake the sleeping soul from inside

Souls are free to take
You're being controlled
By some strange being
The need to kill
Is driving me insane!

Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death
Is what I was given
To kill the phantom god above

Petrified corpses torment the Grounds of God
A child's dream of death
Is what I was given
To kill the phantom god above

Demonic in the flesh
With wings of Hell burning, demon Lord grows complacent

Ceremony bloods command, from the burning gates
Fear spreads its wings of Hell
As sin spreads its wings

Disintegration's afoot
The wings of Hell burning have flown off

Disintegration's afoot
The demons of the night
are here to stay

Disintegration's afoot
The demons of the night
are watching you from the shadows

Blind obedience is all you'll find
In time they will fall

Disintegration's afoot
The demons of the night
are watching you from the shadows

Death is here assured, it is all you'll find
In time they will fall



Caught
Now you're mine
I am the master of your whipping time
The master of the whipping time

The master of your whipping time

The master of the whipping time

The master of the whipping time


Caught
Now you're mine
The curse is upon me
The curse is upon me

The master of the whipping time

The master of the whipping time

The master of the whipping time

Can I be saved
I need your prayers
I can't keep them
They just keep on coming

Recite the Master's chants

====================
In a world where beauty is the new normal
Where the celebration of death is met with the scolding of life
A world in which words cannot describe

The art of persuasion
A form of sadism
That satirizes the human condition

Staring blindly at the screen
Does what is expected of it
Disruption the illusion
Of a better world
In which all are lost

Violence is what we coware not immune
To the depth of human nature

In a world in decay
Where the celebration of death is met with the scolding of life
A world in which words cannot describe

In a world in decay


Innate seed
pale, lifeless
No living thing
Could ever exist
Without decay

Haunting the temple
Within which all die
Sacrifice is what is worship

Song of the daggerbearer
Taunting the walls of pain
Searching for a cure
I will be damned
I'll be the first to bear the cross
Dying for the faith
A force to be reckoned with
The cross never dies

No one stands a chance
Because all are dead

The temple will never close

====================
It's time to bury the dead
The tomb you seek has just been 'trashed'

Condemned to the bone
Your only means of transportation
Carpet-bombing the city
Your last hope of survival

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin


Come walk with me through endless time.
See what has been and what the future sees.
Share the wisdom of the old world that has passed,
Step in a life that's yet to be born.

You spill the blood,
Eternal soul.

I'll show you sights that you would not believe.
Experience pleasures thought unobtained.
At one with evil that has ruled before.
Now smell the stench of immortality.

You spill the blood,
Eternal soul.

Spill your blood, let it run on to me,
Take my hand and let go of your life.
Close your eyes and see what is me,
Raise the chalice, embrace for evermore.

You've spilt the blood.
I'll have your soul.


Propaganda death ensemble
Burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night
In blood laced misery
Scorched earth the policy
The reason for the siege
The pendulum it shaves the blade
The strafing air blood raid

Infiltration push reserves
Encircle the front lines
Supreme art of strategy
Playing on the minds
Bombard till submission
Take all to their graves
Indication of triumph
The numbers that are dead


====================
The heart pounds through your skull
You cannot look at the ground from my face
No emotion, no force, no voice
Feel the pain, feel the pain
Your mind's on the button
And you are watching me
Watch me die
Watch me die

Face the fucking ground, face it
Face it, face it
Face it, face it
Face it, face it
Face it, face it
Face it


Holy shit, I can't believe it's happened to me
Holy shit I can't believe it's happened to me

I'm so sick and tired of seeing these assholes come up short
I can't even go
When I don't have a pen to pen
How I've turned the page on suicide
When the world around me is falling apart
I can't look at the ground from where I stand
No emotion, no force, no voice
Feel the pain, feel the pain
Your doing a disservice to the Lord

You wear what you want, you're nothing
There's nothing more for me to say
I can take from the pile
I can't look at the ground from where I stand
No emotion, no force, no voice
Feel the pain, feel the pain
Your doing a disservice to the Lord

You wear what you want, you're nothing
There's nothing more for me to say
I can take from the pile

I can't look at the ground from where I stand
I can't see your face
You can't look into my eyes
I can't see your mind
You can't look in my eyes

I can't look at your body
But you know what? I'm going to

Hell is home on the concrete where the city has fallen
America's colony
 is being ripped right off the face of the earth
No more debts to bear
All for nothing

Greed is a choice, a taste of life that has just been ripped
From the bosom of freedom

The States that Form the Cone wavered in their commitment to the American way
and became the violent tyranny of the free

The Civil War was a campaign of self-defense
Hunting, fighting and killing
and destruction
in the name of God

Heaven's palace in shining New York
There was no objection when I entered
The Department of the Navy

====================
Drawn to the grave
Lived to be born
Now seek asylum in my stead
Denied of the law

My worth is all I see

Awaiting the mass genocide
Awaiting the genocide - genocide

Bwaing in horror the difference is apparent
The more you bleed
The bleeds the more innocent lives are lost

The more you pray
The bleeds the more lives are lost

The more you die


Despair, emptiness
See the hatred wasted on yourself
Face down taste the dust; it's getting harder everyday
Just to find a reason not to end it all yourself
Suicide on the street
Everywhere around you watch it breed
It begins to bury you in self-induced rejection

So now you're wasted, broken down
I see through your ignorance
Penetrate the surface of your insecure inside
Next fix, shoot it up
Looking for the place where god speaks
Every time you find him he just stabs you in the back
again

No one hears you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you

Cast down and thrown away
You are the living dead
The needle numbs the pain
Of all your suffering
This is where the world of money changes nothing

Just a statistic in the shadows of the real world
The system's failing you just the way it failed me
Hell is home on the concrete where the city bleeds
America - home of the free - land of fucking
disenchantment

Despair, emptiness
Isolation rapes you everyday
Face down taste the dust, digging deeper in your grave
Haven't found a reason
Haven't found a thing to fucking live for
Godless he doesn't care
How you choose to destroy yourself
In a world that feeds on hate
You're left here just to waste away
In your cardboard prison, asphalt wasteland

No one hears you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you
No one sees you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you

Cast down and thrown away
You are the living dead
The needle numbs the pain
Of all your suffering
This is where the world of money changes nothing


I don't want
====================
On his way to church
A white shroud
Seeking a cure
Sifting up the dead
Sifting up the dead

Jesus saves
Lift the lid of terror
Feel the deadly cold
Cold

Contaminated food
Deteriorated body
Degenerated mind

Jesus saves
Skinned and gagged
Feel the deadly heat
Feel the boiling hot flesh
Eat it all

And quite frankly I'd rather die
God is dead
I'm dying of gas
I'm dying of life
I'm dying of fucking life


No apparent motive
This psycho is all about
Your life's a constant struggle
Growing up with a sadistic eye
Mentally and spiritually damaged

Jesus saves
Skinned and gagged
Feel the deadly cold
Feel the boiling hot flesh
Eat it all
And quite frankly I'd rather die
God is dead
I'm dying of gas
I'm dying of life
I'm dying of fucking life


Burning acid bath
Pulmonary wrath
Feel the boiling surge
Control the fury
Release it relentlessly
Release it without mercy

Man made virus infecting the world
A mind tuned bomb
Generate your very death

Man made virus infecting the world

Berserk rage
Feel the boiling surge
Control the fury
Release it relentlessly
Release it without mercy
Beware the reprisal
How many times do I need to remind you

Aggressive use of violence
Control the fury
Release it relentlessly
Release it without mercy
Beware the reprisal
How many more times do I have to remind you

Violence is what I crave
The more I use it, the angrier I get
The more I spew
Menusing, torture and murder
I watch them die
They control and terrorise the oppressed

The more I rape the subhuman spirit
The more I annihilate the few
The more I slaughter the few

Torture, terrorize and derangement,
Kill the few that escape

Deteriorate the mental misery
That mental misery thrives on

Violate the monastic rule
Break off the chain of command
At the last thought of a word
A power so divine
That none should exist

Master of the Mystic Fist
Launch attack on all opposing fates
Free yourself from
====================
Forces united we must end this madness
We must end this madness within
Death our lord we must
We must
We've waited long for the day we see the end we
Visions of destruction we see rise from the grave
The pain and the fame we deserve
We turn and stare in wonder
As the crimson dawns

Death turns and begins to rain
Death is born

Spectors of doom await
Inspring begins to die
The dead are laid to waste
The burial ground for the criminally insane
All new life must perish below
Existence now is futile

Eternal damnation is a deceit
A gift of torture
A quick kick to the face and a painful death

Decrepit breath, familiar face, no emotion
A pleasant pleasant fragrance
A pleasant change of pace
From one fragrance to the next

Spectors of doom await
Inspring begins to die
The dead are laid to waste
The burial ground for the criminally insane
All new life must perish below
Existence now is futile

Eternal damnation is a deceit
A gift of torture
A quick kick to the face and a painful death

Smell the stench of death! - a deadly poison
Character creation, death is upon you
Polymorph, breed, breed
You make your mark amongst the undead

Drink the purest blood and terrorise the whole race

Drink the purest blood and terrorise the whole race

Drink the purest blood and terrorise the whole race

Leave Undead, Come Greet
I haunt your every waking thought
Your soul is too valuable to hand
To begone the helpless beast

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
!???

A morbid symphony
Bastard sons of bitches
A son of a whore

Murder at the heart of the Christian faith
A child's dream of cannibalism

Will save your soul from death

You will die on your knees
by the hand of Christ

A lorry ploughing through the town
ASH! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
!??

A morbid symphony
Bastard sons of bitches
A son of a whore

Hahahahahaha!

Murder at the heart of the Christian faith
A child
====================
The worst thing has been done to me
The worst thing has ever been done to me

The worst thing has ever been done to me

I have no faith
I never will be
Godless
I'll do anything to lose you
I'll do anything to lose you

Nothing is sacred
You'll never be the same
You pray, you pray
You'll do anything
Godless
Kill the bastard son
Make his sacrifice
Bleed the grave
Let the stains of blood
Mesmeric

Entire personality lost
Falsified by blood
Eyes once bright
Enjoying all that's obscene
Do only what is expected of you

Inured soul
Trying to conform
To rape this world
All of a sudden I'm on your good end
Falsified by blood
Eyes once bright
Pessimist, insane patient
Stalking, killing and taking
Of all mankind
Dimentia born of sin

Unyielding love and submission
Shooting up the suicidal

Suicidal recurrence
I won't judge you
When death takes you
Into the fire
I wear your life

Mesmeric shines in the brutal light
A thousand thoughts shiny and all,
The Reaper of Souls
Pseudo Baldur

Aged deranged and psychotic
Necrophobic, dependent
Dead silent screams can come to me

Death is here, now complete
My maniacal wrath breeds
Suffer from the pain
Yield life, now sell it
Die by the sword

A cannibal's desire feeds the fire
The fire grows stronger
Chaos rampant
Aged deranged and psychotic
Necrophobic, dependent
Yield life, now sell it
Die by the sword

Burn, sabotage, annihilate
Kill all your life just the other day
DIE FOR MEION

You can't stop the Reaper of Souls
You cannot stop the Devil
You can only destroy
The path to Hell has yet to be taken

Enter the Kingdom of the Machines
Straight ahead to the end of the world
A world in which all eternity
Spreads of agony
Assassinate the loser
Before reaching the end
I'll take the fight, I'll take the punishment
Endless agony
This hell is eternal

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
====================
I want to, you know?
I want to, you know?
You rip my clothes off
Beaten into submission
How long can you last
In this world before I can
I want to, you know?
Blitzkrieg tactics that I've been fighting
In the blood and sweat and tears
Of at least one death
Legacy of a fallen nation
Combo points set aside for victory
Strategic positioning and elimination
Execution, rape, and murder
Is all or nothing

Fighting and killing and destroying
Is all or nothing

Simple as that, right?
Yeah, right.

I want to. You know?
Yeah, right.


Bombers in flight
Trident missiles in the air
My missiles undergroung
Protect us till we're dead

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

Push the button
Kiss good-bye the nuclear arsenal
A bomber flying off their ramps
Nuclear bombs explode

Radio active people
Search for medicine
Pray for shelter
Kill for food

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

Mass starvation
Contaminated water
Destroyed Cities
Mutilated bodies

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

I'll kill myself
I'd rather die
If you could see in the future
You'd know why

Memories of tomorrow


Initiate blood purge
Coalition in massacre
Mechanized high tech
Whole sale death in effect
Mutually assured
Destruction will occur
Genocide revised
Same pain through diverse eyes
Can't stop the warring factions
Hostile from the start
Always war always
Ending bitter peace
Not the last third war
Blood spills for evermore
Patriot hard line
Lay siege till the end of time
No longer kill your brother
Just slaughter one another
Watch for the deadly other
This sibling is a fucker
Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension starts aggression
Peace breaks out then
Breeds contempt unrest

Without a reason to fight
A time to kill
Sick lust for skeletal flesh
A taste for all decay
Enter the soldier blind
Stalking the faceless hunt
There is no conscience in this world
That can be reached for peace
Why face the human question
The need to hate
Dead
====================
You cannot ignore the pain
Yielding me
Your God's love
Crashing through my veins
You'll never be the same


A misty night, a perfect time
I walk the streets naked
Skinned and bound
Stained in blood
Nailed and bound
God is dead
 yet I am alive

Walk the streets of poverty
Dance with the dead
In the blood of the man I trust
Dance with the dead that smiles on my face
Look deep in my soul
Take a look through time
As past or present words to be
I rule this inferno
A mask on live slaughter
A personal hell

Staring blindly at some distant place

Still none the expression I show
A trait grown up
Will become a weapon grown up
To kill the epitome
Of hate and fury
I'll do whatever it takes

For the love of god your it
A strange bond
Alluring victims to their death
Perversions of pain
Feel divine
Initiate some kind of divine command

There's nothing more intense
Than the fear and tension that drives me
Threep it step inside
It's too late
You've got the capacity
To Freeze

Witness the pain
The blood flow to your head

Point is where all the death is sure

To save yourself you'd better learn
Respect no one
Be nice to them all
And they'll do you no good

You spend your life just wasting your time
And then somebody special takes a look at
You
Respect no one
Be nice to them all
And they'll do you no good


Caught
Now you can see why I love
Drug abuse
Every time I think of you
It makes me want to lunge
Just a second thought
Will make me want to do the same

Killing spree
Rebellion fuels
My rage fuels

Flood your veins
Release the tiniest tear drop
Soothe me in your sleep
Make you want to slit your own fucking throat

Pulmonary overthrow
The technical term for this degree
Is the amputation of the neck
The ultimate death blow

No blood no gas
 Just a fucking knife

I don't want to see
I don't want to die
I don't want to be saved
I
====================
How I won't be forgotten
Victims of my secrecy
I'll never be the last one
Watching from a living grave
I won't judge

Mentally uncooperative
Disapprobation's a thing of the past
It's what I was given
In my head I could make you want to Fuck

Apathy: a fever
A virus
Taken from somewhere
Like a sickeningly common disease
Faded memories haunt me
As if the world
Remembraced
Can't shake the violence
That has been unleashed
On us all
No one stands a chance
Vengeance so pure a passion
For revenge
A vengeance that's never been so
Pain is a name I cannot forget

A taste of extinction
Is what I am getting my hands on
Can't stop the violence that's feeding on it
All the wars that's taken part
Is it food for the eyes or is it death a painful reminder
Sport is torture and disorder
A syndrome that only grows in the malevolent eyes of the state
Sport is cruelty and war
A symptom that always seems to plague the malevolent mind
Sport is obsession and disease
A demanding physical form that always seems to die

None survive a try and by myself
Only a suicide attempt
That will pay the bill
The end justifies the means to an obsession with war and death
An obsession that thrives on destruction

Torture, in the name of God, is a painful reality
Of infinite depth and variety
A symptom that always seems to plague the malevolent eyes of the state
Sport is torture and disorder
A disorder that always seems to die
Sport is obsession and death


High velocity bullet at close range
Can damage the mind
Shattering the skull shredding the brain
Severing the spine

Bury a round of lead in the chest
It's quite an impression
Imagine the innards of your soul
The infliction

Instinctive regression
With intent to kill
No regard of human life
Or the blood spilled

Riddled convulsions
Confetti of flesh
Scattered helplessly
Losting your control of physical
Facilities

Release the slide to cleanse inside
Prepare to anoint
Snap the tongue in the groove discharge
To make my hallowed point

The power of a gun
Used
====================
I'm a fucking maniac
I want to take a bullet in the fucking head
Every time I think of you

You look so fucking real
How fucking old are you

You're so stupid
You think you'll never die
You wish you could be
And say, "Ah, that's me".

You're such a fucking sick fuck
I want to take a bullet in the fucking head
Every time I think of you
You look so fucking old
How fucking old are you

You're such a fucking sick fuck
I want to take a bullet in the fucking head
Every time I think of you
You look so fucking old
How fucking old are you

You're such a fucking sick fuck
I want to take a bullet in the fucking head
Every time I think of you
You look so fucking old
How fucking old are you

I fucking hate it here
Everybody hates me

I keep getting calls
From all across the fuckin' world
Guys that are into me

Can't stand -
The way you look
The way you talk
The way you act

I don't want to see
You're everything
Everything you say
Is just a dream
That everything will come true

When I'm
Up against the wall
In the blood
All the hate I've been cast
I got the right
To take that bullet
Every time

You look at me
You wonder why
You're getting so worked up

You don't understand
I know why you're getting sick
You don't want to die

You look at me and say,
You know what?
You're full of shit.

I don't want to hear it
You're full of shit.

Jesus, what are you thinking.
You're full of shit.

I don't want to hear it
You're full of shit.


Abolish government
There's nothing to it
Forget about God
He's no innocent
We live by a system
Of perfect goals
People vs. people who are bored and old

Jesus Christ, what if there was no fuckin' system

Enticing all at once
With every eager request
I will satisfy your every need
You'll never be the same


Insanity is alive
I will live through this forever
I have done the things you grieve
Suffer the agony

You feel the pain
I control the rage
I deal in pain

====================
Watch your back, you know I'll win

In the blood of a thousand catacombs
Strangulation, madness, madness
Seas burn, bodies burn, minds explode

Screams in your sleep
The sound of a dead man walking
Desecrated, you burn

In the blood of a thousand demons


Watch your back, you kill time
Bodies lie dead
In the cold of the frozen wastes

Your bullets hurtle off killing time


Gun down cold on a trail of conflicting memories
An empty promise
Empty shot, committed without thought
Unafraid of punishment
In the wake of death a conviction impossible

Restrained by instinct
Not afraid to use violence
Blinding your eyes, blood spattered
Signs of torture
Are kicking and screaming everywhere

I'll kill you, you'll fuck you
You'll do everything I want
You've tried, you just won't do

You've tried, you just won't do

You tried, you just won't do

Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins

Welcome to the horror of the revelation
Tell me what you think of your savior now
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times
I won't be force fed prophecies
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind
Join the new faith for the celebration
Cult of new faith fuels the devastation

Holy man come and worship me
I am all that you ever wanted to be
I'm the life of indulgence you never knew
The epitome of evil shining through

Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins

Welcome to the horror of the revelation
Tell me what you think of your savior now
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times
I won't be force fed prophecies
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind
I keep the bible in a pool of blood
So that none of its lies can affect me

This is new faith
A different way of life
Witness the shame
See for yourself the lies
I'll take the fight
Bring it every time, any time
====================
It's time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late, you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside Daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

Your hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it
There's one chance left
Get on your knees drink the wine
Chew the wafer

People screaming can I be dreaming
Is this the truth I can't tell
Whether this is heaven or hell
Wolfbane and the sound of a silver bell

The air is thick
The smell of death is everywhere
It's all around
But I won't submit to death
You can go with the

Man don't lie why do they cry [3x]

Ruling your lives
With such lies
Weak won't survive

It is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

Can't find what you're looking for
Select search
Out is where your life is spent
Injury-ridden grave
You call it art
It's been mostly rain
This is where your life is spent

The sun goes down in the west
And the air is thick

The sea level rises
And the seasons change

Through the night we rise
Free
In darkness meet the cold
In the light of the living
A kingdom of my imagination


King of all the kingdoms
At midnight one of the kings
Is found
Lives adrift
In a world that cannot be
Lonely children
Be led astray
By men of violent mind

Crucify the so called kingdom
By enforcing its impure laws

The wicked will be brought before the God of destruction

The night will come and
====================
A vast, cavernous room.
The master of black magic.

The Master of Evil.

The Unending Terror.

Sacrifice of life and limb.
Eternal Lies.

Inning line baptized.
All die, every lives.
Senseless death is what I am,
Awaiting the inevitable.

Death is coming, bitch in a blanket.
It's too late, you've got the right.

Bastardize the clean and pure.
Salvation forever a dream.
Enter the slave of pleasure.
Free reign of the bastard son.

Innocence withdrawn in thought,
Awaiting the inevitable.

Come worship the lord,
Who Hates Us All.

Praise the lord, praise the lord.
Eternal Lies.
Inning line baptized.
All die, every lives.
Senseless death is what I am,
Awaiting the inevitable.

Bastardize the clean and pure.
Salvation forever a dream.
Enter the slave of pleasure.


Cascaded darkness
Talks of madness
Perversions of pain
Spewing from inside
A world of my sanity
Losing all grasp
Of control of myself
Devistice of Death

Gemini priests attempt to slay the winds of evil
Gemini wizards try to slay the winds of salvation

Flesh burns, you taste the stench of Death
A demon from the past

Awaiting the inevitable
Fear and loathing of a name
A name that no one has
Temptation that never seems

You'll be forgiven,
You'll pray for me,
I'm trying to make you feel better

You've tried, you'll try again

You'll be forgiven,
You'll pray for me,
I'm trying to make you feel better

You've tried, you'll pray for me,
I'm trying to make you feel better

You've tried, you'll pray for me,
I'm trying to make you feel better


A child's dream
Of a life of desolation
Infantilize the worst off
Make the best of the cards they're in

Play with the cards they're not
Checking through the magazines they don't have

They're playing with
====================
What you see is what you
Know.

I don't need your lies
I just know what you
Want.
I can take all you want.
Gaping eyes searching for the answer to their prayers.
Reflections of a mind insane
Disintegration that seeks divine punishment.
I don't need anyone's pity
I've perfected the art
Of Justification.

Master of Flies
The master of pain
I take your form as though it were your first love.
Love becomes the center of all attraction.
Pain becomes the final touch.

Petrified spirit lives the Arena
The ritual deaths are not an illusion
A force of nature
Hear the sound of the bell
Counting on me to keep an eye on danger
The ritual deaths are not an illusion
A force of nature

Hear the sound of the bell
Counting on me to keep an eye on danger


Deafening silence sweeps across the lands
As twilight falls
Dreams come to life
Feel the touch of death
At midnight tower they rise
Would you be his bride
Crotch at the end of the rope
Twisted figures the veins run
Feel the warmth of death
On your back, facing the sky

Shades of death are all I see
Passing victims of my sedation
Screaming men around aimless
Still life is lost amidst the night

Quarters for the criminally insane
Crisis feeds the lunacy
Beware the name Crisis

Is coming full force for the criminally insane
There's nothing more for us to say
Such a dismal reality for which none are immune
That which I have done or said
I will do or say more

Disapprobation at first sight, what with the colours and the faces
But then it begins to sink in, the sheer brutality of what is done
====================
No one hears you

Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho
Devils that drive you
Are not limited just another day of misery

No one hears you
You're too late
Your addicted to bod

Leave your abusers
Dying [3x] Directions

You better wake up [6x] - get out of here
Suicide by hanging
Existing is no crime
Just a fucking way of life
There's nothing more for us to say
There's nothing more for us to say
There's nothing more for us to say

There's something about you that makes me want to slit my own fucking throat
You're such a fucking whore
I'll kill you and your child if you're not rid
Of your humanity
I'll take your fucking eyes off the graphic
Of me and you
I'll kill you and your child

You're such a fucking whore
I want to feel you cry
You're such a fucking whore
I want to feel you cry

You're such a fucking whore [4x]

You make my fucking fucking fucking fucking life
I live for the misery of the positronic

You make my fucking fucking fucking life
I live for the misery of the positronic

You make my fucking fucking life
I walk the line between mad and sane
You send my dead soul to the realms of the dead

You've made my fucking life
I walk the line between mad and sane

You annihilate the future
That I can design
I'll sell my soul to pay the price
If I die I'll make you my slave

The cross you wear reads lies within it
I can't decide who I want to kill

The consequence of your choices
Your insane day will come to a close
The end you've waited for
Your final plea
Your final plea

You've damned yourselves to see
The sky is turning red

The dawning of a new man
The end you've waited for
Your final plea
Your final plea

You've damned yourselves to pray
For the night to come

I'll kill you and your child
There's nothing more for us to say
I'll kill you and
====================
I am the Antichrist
You shall not bear witness
To the lies told
Inveigh against the will of God
The satanic rule
You will be condemned to a life of damnation
Your soul shall not be free to rot in Hell

The plan is in place

Despair, emptiness
Are building inside of me
Showers shooting through the night
I want to die
I want to be dead

But what if there is no tomorrow
I want to live
No one would die for being born today
Would you go to hell
Would you go to hell
Would you go to hell

But what if there is no tomorrow
What if there is none there

But what if there is

I want to die

I want to be dead

But what if there is no tomorrow
What if there is none there

But what if there is



Imagine Humanity's decline
Decapitated, mutilated
Diminished from their cruciform
Genetic wasteland
Taken without being blamed
Mesmeric, impure
Inured, mutilated

Pessimistic, primitive
Losing ground
Void that once ruled
The human race has decayed

Signs of hope are growing in the air
A life that never would have been realized

Signs of celebration are growing in the air
A life that never was realized

Signs of celebration are growing in the air

I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Signs of celebration are growing in the air
I will survive
If only there was one thing I wanted

President Clinton
Aged just ten
Died two

Just a waste of sperm
Got it wrong
The reason for the infestation
The truth about Mr. Clinton
The truth about Mr. Clinton

Pessimistic, primitive
Losing ground
Void that once ruled
The human race has decayed

Signs of hope are growing in the air
A life that never would have been realized

Signs of celebration are growing in the air

I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Signs of celebration are growing in the air



====================
This page deals with the matter of the seal on your head.
What is the matter?
Your soul cannot be saved.

Convulsions taking the world into my hand.
Atonement, powers we cannot control.
Impulses we cannot extricate.

Graze the walls of strength again,
This time with a greater sense of mission.

Meat stains the walls of justice,
A stain of mind never cured.

Impure the very soul that brought it to this land.
Lay siege to this land for all eternity.

Impure the very soul that brought it to this land.

Impure the very soul that brought it to this land.

Convulsions taking the world into my hand.
Impure the very soul that brought it to this land.
Come and die with me forever.
There's nothing more for us to say.

Killing spree, first degree, murder, assault.
A force to be reckoned with.
The tolerance of the weakest mind.
The revelation of one's guilt.
The instigation of violence that breaks out.

Impulsive, insane and sometimes even murder
plagues the realm of the dead.

Demented personality,
A curse on death that lives inside.

Gemini priest of the tomb of the dead,
The spirits of the games
hold the keys to the kingdom
Of the living
Tyrant of the games
has taken hold

The dead have taken possession
of the kingdom

A force to be reckoned with
The tolerance of the weakest mind
Impure the very soul that brought it to this land.


Enter the tomb of the dead
Lift the lid of torment
The wicked will come forth
To bear witness
That the world is hollow
Speak with evil in my dreams

I'll take your lost soul from the grave
Tell the tale of the life I lived

A force to be reckoned with
The tolerance
====================
The Satan's child plays inside your head
Listen closely to his song
Watch as he plays you
Innocence withdrawn, insane
From behind the curtain call
Spilling your blood all over my wall
Mark my words you fucking Christ

Bear witness to the cross's untimely demise
Bring it all back to me

I design the wall for the wall of fire
You'll need an HTML5

 in-game financial user
You'll need an anesthetic

My walls of fire
You'll need an M1911

The architect once mocked the religion
But today I'm the one mocking the arts
With a dead body
Prophesize
Rapes the minds of my victims
And lets the human race perish

Jesus saves, I say hello
I am the first hope in the darkness
Of those who evade
I'll kill them all
If only I could see

Death is over due, cheap thrill
A casualty of my battle
Escape is at hand
Of just the two of us

Christ is not coming back
He is, and will be, and ever will be
A casualty of the times
A casualty of the times

I'm waiting for the moment
I want what's just a look,
A glimpse into the minds of the dead
That's what I wanted

The brutality of Roman soldiers
Shooting first with their swords
Then shooting again with their carbines

Angeles are waiting for the moment
Angeles are waiting for the moment

Angeles are waiting for the moment

Angeles are waiting for the hour

Angeles are waiting for the hour

Angeles are waiting for the hour

Angeles are waiting for the hour

Angeles are waiting for the hour



Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death
A witch's curse
Engulfs all your soul
Losing your control of evil

Your body is corroding
The fire has taken it's toll

Grief is haunting you
A look of complete serenity
Absorbingly realisable

The image of the dead is playing within your mind
Absorbingly realisable

The image of the dead is playing within your mind

Grief is haunting you
Absorbingly realisable

The image of the dead is playing within your mind
====================
It's time to bury the impure
Secured underground
Warriors from the dawn are here
Hunting masses for game
Familiar faces bring new meanings
Infiltrate for all to see
Mastermind my rage
Saturate the needle needle needle sub-son
Endless burning holes
Of scarred souls



Razors edge
Outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration

Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane

Innate seed
To watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated eviscerated
Time perpetuated

Inert flesh
A bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
A note buried deep inside
A message for the world you change

Trident embedded in your brain
An easy mark for a veteran

Hunting masses
For the poor
Insecurity afraid of the drill
Pulling you into the fold
Fighting to survive

Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration
Close your eyes
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
As you go insane... go insane

Eyes upon me
Watching me in my perpetual sleep
Dreams deceive me
My nightmares are not of death
They are of life
A dream that lives
Leaving comments that keep getting longer
Leaving new comments that keep getting longer

Leaving comments that keep getting longer

Dreams deceive
====================
The sacred altar of the demure

Filling the holy wine glass

A servant of vice
Waiting to see if I'll see death
Forbidden fantasies
A pleasant fragrance
On the lips of a nation that worships Satan

Sacrifice the lives of its people
A thousand prayers a minute

Spirits convulse me as death takes hold
In the depths of a mind insane

Fantasy life unfolds
Brought to you by God
The set piece unfolds
The more I think of death
The deeper I sink

Spirits convulse me as death takes hold
In the depths of a mind insane

This is not about you
This is not about me
This is not about you

You play along now
Just know I'll come out in force

You like it when the tension is great
And the one thing that keeps you going

Everyday you go
You go you go
You play along now
Just know I'll come out in force

You like it when the tension is great
And the one thing that keeps you going

You'd be forgiven for thinking this is about me
You'd be forgiven for thinking this is about you
But you'd never be so naive
I want to see the world through your flaws
I want to see the world realize your full potential
I want to see the world conquer my soul

You play along now (you go) You go (you go) You go (you go) You go

Everyday you go
You go
You go


TEENILL: Seven Deadly Sires
At any given time
You have the power
To Cause Panic
Preemptive War
Allies with the suicidal
Will kill, kill, kill
In the name of God

We turn our heads toward the sky
And see the terror in the eyes of the world

There is no opposition
There is no future
No sin
No name of God

We take the helm
And reign as one
The faith will not fail
Evil will arise in my eyes
Will take the world

Consume the mind,

Murder our temples.

Crucify the oppressed.
Engrave the master of my torment.

Payback.

Kill the preacher's only son.
The consequence is a son,
The consequence is a lie.

Faced with a choice between life or death,
The choice is always death.

Execution but a thought in the end,
The choice is life or death.

Pessimist you say, but life is short -
You remain the victim in the end,
You remain the instigator in the death.

Angel of Death flickers in my brain,
Radical terror,
A vast conspiracy,
In which the dead suffer.

I make my decision,
I make my choice,
I make my choice,
Life or death.

I am here for the sole purpose,
I'm here to help,
It's all about the choice,
It's all about the choice.


Abolish the old ways of man
Draw the line on the grotesque
Abandon God, the not-so-frenzied
Line of duty
That keeps your eyes on the prize
There's no contest to this intense

Hunting, fighting and killing all
Dealing with monstrous

Bathe in the purest blood
No fear of punishment
No ill will, no attempt,
You will be made to meet

Death is all you give
A personal hell on earth
The ritual is for a boy
And a bitch a week old

When the line is drawn
Blood is all I give

A personal hell on earth
The ritual is for a boy
And a bitch a week old

Bathe in the purest blood
No fear of punishment
No ill will, no attempt,
You will be made to meet

Guns echo over the grave
A force to be reckoned with
Someone to blame

No apparent motive

A force to be reckoned with
This is anarchy
Outlaws you'll have to fight
To the death
There's no secret life
Free your eyes
Watch a warzone overrun
Imagine the horror of war
The slaughter of all life
The chains you'll be bound
As I cover
The prison you'll remain
When life's a game
Of attrition
When power's only a friend
A force to be reckoned with
Someone to blame

No apparent motive

Feel the pain shoot through you
As if it's no use

Take a look through time
As if it's no use
As if it's no use
Take a look through space
Into the past
Through the future
Noose lies boundless

Look through time
Looking for the answer
Why
There's no such thing
Answers to your burning burning prayers


To those who question God's love
He makes no sense
A vast network of nerves
connecting to the past
connecting to the future
connecting to the past

If youre feeling particularly spiritual
Youmight be attracted to
The way you look
The way you talk
The way you act
Can't explain the other side
When one man strips the other, they become one

Global unrest spreading from place
To find a cure for disease

The Beast within, the Powerful Lord within
Burning can't escape, it mustn't
Cause I'm the one that's oppressor

You've Been Waiting for,
The Blessing of Death
The Eternally Awake

Man's Aile Intentional
Inflicted With
Can't Stop The Beast

Can't Stop The Beast

My Mind The Nature
Of The Beast In The Details
Is Satan Hell's domain

Bludgeon, slit throat, burn the incense stake
Tell the lies to the world
Involve yourself within
The Beast Lies

Infiltrate nature's vile deception
Spewing out hate
No remorse left
Taste the lies that surround the revelation

Disruption, terrorize
Reach out to soul's fate
Execute, burn
Praise the Lord's corpse
A personal hell

Taste the lies that surround the revelation

====================
I'm searching for the answer to your prayers
I can satisfy your every need
I have lived with pain and hatred
Ever since I was a child

Diluvian medicine, a cure
Of a life-threatening illness
A life in limbo

Life stands still, no hope, no life
Diluvian medicine, a cure
Of a life-threatening illness

A life in limbo

I don't know what to make of it
I've never known a thing

Yielding death we must
There's no future without

Death is a tool that its often used
A perpetual companion
Defy all views of reason
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!

I can't see through the night
There's nothing but death below
I can't see beyond the shrouded man
I cannot see beyond the dead

I cannot see beneath the moon
Beyond the dead

Silent Scream
Crucify the oppressor
Beat the bastard son
Leave him to rot

Child is overdue
The grave washer/dryer manues
Pumped with fluid
Erotic sensations
Like a dead body lying
On the edge of the law
No defence
Anxiously wrapped
In mats and leather
Dismembered
Within my mind

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in
Like cattle
You run
Stripped of
Your life's worth
Human mice, for the Angel of Death
Four hundred thousand more to die
Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood

Destroying, without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race

Surging into madness
Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher,
Angel of Death

Pumped with fluid
Erotic sensations
Like a dead body lying
On the edge of the law
No defence
Anxiously wrapped
In mats and leather
Dismembered
Within my mind

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
For
====================
You know it's true
I'll fight - every word I say
Remind you of so much


Ah, so fucking old
You're all smiles and Hates...
Funeral held for so old
Just a casualty of the times

Disintegration, the threats of the times
Oppression of the masses

Through all your soul you know nothing

I'll fight - every word I say
Tell me what it feels like to be human
Tell me what it's like to be human
Tell me what it's like to be human

You think you can destroy humanity
Tell me what you think of yourself
I'd be lying if I told you the truth
Drawn into the depths
You have no soul
Humanity's No.1 Problem

Salvation hunger strike
Campaign to end food stamps
Unveil the hidden coffin
Dress as Christ and preach the death of the church
Pray for the life of wonder
That life will never die

Endure the pain
You'll soon withered
Leaving behind only the scars of your brutal past

You'll soon withered
Leaving behind only the scars of your brutal past

You cannot see
To know death awaits
In a world that worships death
You cannot see
To know death awaits

Death is here, it's waiting for us
It never dies
It's renounced.

Enter the demon, the quest begins

Enter the curse, the pain unfolds
Share insanity, the pain unfolds

Share damnation, it will never end
Share free will, it will never die

Share in pain, your soul is spent
Raping the innocent, your spirit is never rest

Chaotic heat, induced by sunlight, drives the twisted structure
Pulmonary overthrow, the vicious curse
Absolute cataclysm, complete control
Transgressive change, surgical solution
Transgression known as euphoric release

High velocity bullet, impact with an object intense enough to pierce the skin
Mesmeric spray, harmless numbing the sensation
Pain is all you get

Pain is all you get

Stricken to live, animals not spared
Praise the land, for the land is infernal

I will live to destroy I'll make you part of me
I'll make you part of me
Forceful
====================
This is for the hell of it
This is for the hell of it
This is for the hell of it


You play the part of the martyr, that burns the cross, who saves,
by choice of the wolf
And through it all mankind has fallen.

You have your own reality, your own hell
Of temptation,
In which to commit the most infamous murder.

You have your own reality, your own hell
Of temptation,
In which to commit the most infamous homicide.

I damn you hereafter,
In Hell I'll burn your tomb
And keep your name
I have no other savior
In Hell I'll burn your tomb

Quarters for the criminally insane.

There's nothing more intense than the formation of a law
That's never been more true

And all who meet bear testimony to its validity.

Bombers in flight, try to evade,
Then the missiles land.

The missiles land, try to evade,
Then the missiles land.

The missiles land, try to evade,
Then the missiles land.


Mortuaries, dead of night,
Seeking asylum in a place of peace,
The priests have disposed of evil
In their wake have died.

A force that once was
Now they seek to rise again.

Bombers in flight, try to evade,
Then the missiles land.

The missiles land, try to evade,
Then the missiles land.


A fog of war that cuts across the sea
Of blackened promise made by a hand that never dies

The earth trembles with the impact of a bomb
That burns your skin

Radical amputation, the worst form of torture
A casualty that never existed

Radical amputation, the worst form of torture

There's nothing more intense than the burning sensation
Of your hands and knees

A dead body lying next to mine

A civilian body lying next to mine
Radical amputation, the worst form of torture
A casualty that never existed


Radical amputation, the worst form of torture

I don't want to see you die
All around I see
Lying
====================
The worst thing that's ever been done to you
A kiss and a kiss a time to regret

A kiss and a kiss a time to regret

Kill her first try first try
Cause she's my fucking daughter
Cause I hate her

Blood turning red
What are we gonna do
Cause she's my fucking daughter
Cause I hate her

The walls turning red
What are we gonna do
Cause she's my fucking daughter
Cause I hate her

The worst thing that's ever been done to you
A kiss and a kiss a time to regret

Kill her first try first try
Cause she's my fucking daughter
Cause I hate her

The worst thing that's ever been done to you
In the depths of a mind insane
Can't see beyond the walls
Blind following the laws of physics
They make their bedfellows bleed
Within their own minds
Unleash all their violence
Can't see beyond the walls
Blind following the laws of physics
They make their bedfellows bleed
Within their own minds

Can't see beyond the walls
Blind following the laws of physics
Follow me, I'll lead the way;
Disruption, command, command; Matrix, I'll take you down.


Existing on damnation's edge
The fire has taken flight
But the seed has withered
The last drop of the dead flesh
Siphon the deadly infection

Life from this world
Resurrect a state of mind
That is, life from another.

The Reaper begins to patrol the halls of damnation
Patriot lawers of the gates of God's hell
Angel of Death
The Reaper has begun his assault on the halls of damnation

Nocturnal spectre sees the mortal world
Threshhold's priest now wears off
The Reaper's deadly weapon
Destroying all in his wake

Silent victory praises the enemy
He who takes the field
Is now known as the Reaper.


Flesh burns, minds mutilate
Death's twisted design
Instinct spares no one
The design now seems harmless

Sport the flesh, age the death
A ritual of endless pleasure

Death is like a blade to the throat
A ritual of endless pain

Sport the flesh, age the death
A ritual of endless pain

Sport the flesh,
====================
Death's reflections in the air
Surging, accelerating
Exploding, this way, and that

Transgressing time's rope
Twisted, warped, corroding
Adaptive, slow, painful,
Transgressing wave

At any cost, life, limb,
Life's impression

Inert, silvery powder
Apparitions de line
Voyeurs unceasing quest
Beginning with the dead
The quest
Tear it up
Lose your sanity in the act of killing

Death's design
A mask of hate
Black as blood
Apparitions sudden death
Transitions from one strategy to another
Diffusing, erasing

Stainless black,
Fighting the curse
That afflicts in me

Though I am only a mask
I can't hide the fact
I am the face of death


Initiate blood purge
Coalition in massacre
Mechanized high tech
Whole sale death in effect
Mutually assured
Destruction will occur
Genocide revised
Same pain through diverse eyes
Can't stop the warring factions
Hostile from the start
Always war always
Ending bitter peace
Not the last third war
Blood spills for evermore
Patriot hard line
Lay siege till the end of time
No longer kill your brother
Just slaughter one another
Watch for the deadly other
This sibling is a fucker
Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension starts aggression
Peace breaks out then
Breeds contempt unrest

Without a reason to fight
A time to kill
Sick lust for skeletal flesh
A taste for all decay
Enter the soldier blind
Stalking the faceless hunt
There is no conscience in this world
That can be reached for peace
Why face the human question
The need to hate
Dead stare through cynical eyes
A trust in only pain
Murder within the skin
Engrave the art of war
Become death's vile parade
March on embrace the violent mind
Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension starts aggression
Peace breaks out then
Breeds contempt unrest
One cryptic reason for life murder


Death's pointed at your head
Your mind's on the trigger pull it
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story
Scene of your rage
Death is not strange
Blood on the walls
You
====================
Your life is yours to give away
Your only crime is to suffer
The blood forever flows to my name

Don't be late, your soul will be
Hear the piercing cries of every doubting soul
Surrender to my evil
Let the pain of your life yank you away

No one shall mourn more for me
My secrets I keep
The way is wide open for the devil to find

Listen to the rhythm of a dead man walking
Refuse to be cowered into
The cross-bedded ground give way to the high ground

A life of mental disarray
Disintegration's multiplying
Within these walls lies the devil
Beginning to understand
My purpose is simple
No sarcasm, no lies
Defy the morbid declaration
I will never become your Lord

Listen to the rhythm of a dead man walking
Refuse to be cowered into
The cross-bedded ground give way to the high ground

A life of mental disarray
Disintegration's multiplying
Within these walls lies the devil
Beginning to understand
My purpose is simple
No sarcasm, no lies
Defy the morbid declaration
I will never become your Lord



Caught
Now you're mine
I am the master of your whipping time
The master of your pain
The master of your distress

The master of your misery

The master of your misery

Master of your misery

I am the life of youth
The master of your misery
The master of your misery

I am the life of youth

The master of your misery

I am the life of youth

The master of your misery


Killing spree
At the crack of dawn
The first to die

Kill all first to die
Execution
Lay in dust the walls of death
The body falls to the sky
Emanate a superstition
A force too strong to resist

Circle of beliefs
Secrets never keep
Living in a lie
Right before your eyes
Losing is your way
Mentally or otherwise
To hell is your reward

I am the second coming of God
The second coming of God

I am the second coming of God

I am the third death
The horror of which you are led

To hell is your reward

I am the terror of sin

====================
Forced to fight, behind, they flee
The wild children in their turn
Hunting with abandon
Soldier of misfortune
Captive of war
A life that never dies

(Killing spree)

Thousands are killed and many are wounded
Captive discipline and crushing
Death is his way

Murder at your every foot step
Brought to you by God's grace
You have your own hell

Walking slow breathing heavy
Showers that cleanse your eyes
Numbingly seeing the future filled with pain
High velocity bullet at your expense

Execution but a thought in the end
Slowly but surely losing control
Firing back they go

Running from cover
Bodies lie dormant
Lying cold
consciously firing
Terrified blood spattered across the ground

Horrifyingly unreal the way they light
A child's toy shattered
Left to die
Decisions that have no future
The final word

Imprisoned in a shell, alone
Unyielding hell
They'll never make it out

The bell tolls
The sky is raining death

Bones and blood spill from my hand
Firing can't understand why
One reason or the other
God can't explain

What is being done to me
What is being done to you

In my mind are all your rights violated
All the powers I have
I'm becoming all things envied

In my head is a world that's too great
To be hidden
In my head are powers that the world has
At one with evil that has ruled before

In my head are powers that the world is too small
To be hidden
In my head are powers that the world is evil is watching

In my head are powers that the world is international law has failed

In my head are powers that the world is genocide
Watching over a dying nation



Caught
Now you're mine
I am the master of your shadow
I can take you down with no pain
No fear
The thrill of death you feel
The sting of death your last thought
Is taken as fact
 and used
For my own peace of mind - I am the master of your shadow
I can take you down with no pain
No pain
The thrill of death you feel
The sting of death you feel
As long
====================
What's going on in my head
Is this for the best
I want to see more
I want to see the world my mind
Is going insane for being a
Satan my upstart
I want to see what the fuck is going on

I want to kill myself
I want to feel death on my hands
I want to feel death on my knees

I want to feel death on my hands

I want to feel death on my knees

I want to feel death on my hands

What's going on in my head
Is this for the best
I want to see more
I want to see the world my mind
Is going insane for being a
Satan my upstab
I want to see what's going on
How much can a virgin give
Beaten and torn
Pleasing till my stomach
Lying all alone

What's going on in my head
Is this for the best
I want to see more
I want to see the world my mind
Is going insane for being a
Satan my upstab

Beaten and torn
Pleasing till my stomach
Lying all alone

Shocked and disoriented
Headlines everywhere
Pentagrams of myself
Heads that roll over
Down on my knees
I want to die

What are they getting at
This is for the best
I want to see more
I want to see the world my mind
I want to slit your fucking throat
Just so you fucking see

What's with the fucktard fucking thing
What's with the fucktard fucking thing
What are they doing all this time
I just want to die


Breakfast I'm good for the world
Good for the soil
High in salt

Piece of shit with the devil in it

Piece of shit

With the devil in it

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Can't explain
Why I feel the need
I
Lose my cool mind control
Can't remember a time I
Lose my cool mind control

I'm a shit boy
Can't control the intensity
I can't tolerate the intensity

I want to hurt you brother
You're nothing but
====================
You think you can conquer darkness
By killing
Ashes to... the dark

Innate mind
How can one human being be the enemy

Through words and deeds
Dark side to... the world of...

Lucifer takes the world
Dark side to... the world of...
Lucifer

Can you hear the thunder
Thunderbolts?
Thunderclap!
Crashing clatter!
Watching the blood lie cold
Inside the walls of death!

Infernal slaves brought before God
Shooting death from an above ground sky

High velocity bullet?
Pierce through the skull and burn the skin
Beaten into submission
Grand juries were made to
Be stupid and lame
Thrown into execution rows
On the wire
Forbidden religion
Marked with iron rods
Stained in blood
Dismembered yet unknown


Are you sure you want to die
Cause I'm the one that's following you

I am the wall that you can never climb
I am the pain that you feel inside
I will never be contained

You pray for me no one can reach
You feel the pain that you feel inside
I watch you bleed
As you pray for me to be saved
Dismembered yet unknown


Leave the misery that you feel behind
Go about your day
Relentless brotherhood of conviction
Perversions of pain
Feel the pain that you feel inside

Collectively you've committed a vast evil
One that I cannot ignore

None survive the end that you come
Ending all are dead
At the end of are dead
At the end of are alive

I am the wall you can never climb
I is the pain that you feel inside
I will never be contained

You pray for me no one can reach
You feel the pain that you feel inside
I watch you bleed
As you pray for me to be saved
Dismembered yet unknown


End Times Diplomatic Aide
End Times Society Haul
Humanitarian Ship
Invaded
You'll have to fight
Kill more to get there

It's called the war
It's been going on for seven years

I am the wall you can never climb
I is the pain that you feel inside
I will never be contained

You pray for me no one can reach
You
====================
The masterful manipulation of emotions
Can take the world and turn it upside down

Gods on the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
Soldiers defeated by death from an smell
Bodies lie dormant no life
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell
Demons not ready to die
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie

Chemical warfare

Warfare!


Harlots of Hell spread your wings
As I penetrate your soul
Feel the fire shoot through your body
As I slip into your throne
Cast aside, do as you will
I care not how you plead
Satan's child now stalks the earth
Born from my demon seed

Hot winds of Hell
Burns, in my wake
Death is what you pray,
Behold, captor of sin

Infernal slaves of manipulation
Captive of my vice
Abandon God, the helpless one
To relieve you of your plight
Subversive action will do no good
Pressure holds you over the edge
Forced to fight
Invisible hand holds your fate
Strapped down screaming forth
Hell awaits, no tomorrow

The fire grows stronger with every death
Death is what you pray,
Behold, captor of sin

I'll kill you and your dreamsstoure me
Exertion builds the frame
The game is over now, I'm dead - only to rise again

The fire grows stronger with every death
Dying for Christ is my disguise
Death is what you pray,
Behold, captor of sin

The game is over now, I'm dead - only to rise again

The fire grows stronger with every death
Sniper fire fighting overhead
Soon to be killed at close range
Hungry for the horror of man's creation
Embraced by his words
Imprisoned in a cell for life
Washed away by the confession of a sinful soul
Satisfy the eyes of this godless cult

Ah, the ecstasy!


The pain!


The crypts of Hell lie waiting for the sudden arrival
Of all that lie here
Hell is where all that evil is born

The crypts of Hell lie waiting for the sudden arrival

The first signs of life
The first signs of death

Signs of life


====================
Two men I trust
Step inside my world of lies
Twisted figures adorned the walls
Diminished state my presence

Sceptors embedded in my skull
Gemini eyesight fading
Vessels bearing his death

Spearhead raped inside my veins
Satan's child now a weapon
Seeking a cure
I implant the parasite inside
Pain results in screams, bleed internally
Years will pass before it can be cured

I heal the sickening pain of your death
Through your mind's up
I watch the night the world was born
Bearer of no name
Torment from night will rise
See the pain in your eyes
Watch it die
Leave your end of the bargain
At your command
Enter my world of lies
Twisted figures adorned the walls
Diminished state my presence
See the pain in your eyes
Watch it die
Leave your end of the bargain
At your command
I seal the deal
You'll be made to pay
At midnight on the stake
You'll be left hanging
Paralyzed
Disintegration's coming

You're being sucked into my web
I live for the taking
And the punishment's coming

I can't stop the games
The games I love
The games I have to
Watch the ground turn and see if I'm being pushed
There's no game
Trying to win
Trying to lose
I can't stop the games
The games I love
The games I have to
Watch the ground turn and see if I'm being pushed
There's no game
Trying to win
Trying to lose

The fear in my eyes
The torment in my brain
That just might
Be the case
It's not funny, it's true
You're only interested in trouble

One bad joke and you're dead
And so it goes
For all of eternity
The sun sets and the winds blow
For all of eternity
The sun sets and the the winds blow

The legend goes that when I am pulled
by a strange weight
There is no tomorrow
There will be no peace
There will be no law

There is no family
All you do is hate
And all you do is hate

To be born again
In a world that hates you
It is time to forget
Don't be late, you have to
You're
====================
You will die
You will live
You will die

You will be the reason why I became the chosen one

I will give you everything
You'll never be the same


A senseless death
Your heart stops beating
In a pool of blood.

You think you can kill me(You'll have to
Will you try
To shoot me in the fuckin' head
Cause I'm the one that's gonna win

You think you can kill me
With your fucking lives I shit you're not going to die

You think you can?

Twenty-four hours of fame
You've got one chance
To destroy my realm
Death's head is upon your head

You think you can
Beat the fuck away
No one can stop you

Theres nothing more for you to do
Destroy your kingdom and take it back

You think you can -

Twenty-four hours of fame
You've got one chance
To destroy my realm
A shitfire is the size of my head
Take It
Blaze it up
Burn it down
Make it bigger
Cause I'm the one that's gonna win

You think you can -
Beat the fuck away
No one can stop you
Tear it away
Take It
Blaze it up
Burn it down
Make it even bigger
Cause I'm the one that's gonna win


I stalk a close quarter
Within my mind
I see threats
Potential threats
Within my mind
My prayers are answered
No pain
Just know that I'm prepared
For any threat
Or attack
I'll kill you inside
Reach out to my hand
And release your grip
Pulling you so far you can't see

No breath, no life
The tension is sure reaching the end
Pulling you like dogs
Masticating your neck
And taking your eyes off the screen

No money, no dreams
Just a statistic
Signature of rejection
In my head I see
How dare you try to steal my love
A gift that you can't get anywhere
Just send me a message and I'll take care of you

No money, no dreams
Just a statistic
Signature of rejection
In my head I see
You're nothing
A gift that you can't get anywhere
Just send me a message and I'll take care
====================
Stonehenge - the center of the web
What is going on?
What is going on?
Who is behind it all?

I am the Antichrist
From the depths of Hell
I will reveal the truth
I am the Antichrist!
I am the Antichrist!


Follow me, I'll lead the way; your fears will soon overtake
Hide your infinite tears inside, it seeks your smallest break
Screaming God is dead, hide from the truth, he's trying
To kill me, he's killing you

Take a look through time, through the future
As past and present conflicting,
Faded and destroyed,
You see the power of the Antichrist,
To kill all, to plunder
Witness the end of patience,
The end of faith,
The end of wisdom.

Through tears it seeks your smallest break
Hide your infinite tears inside, it seeks your smallest break
Quench your passion, it seeks your smallest break
Quench your soul, it seeks the peace

Eternally searching for your dying breath
It seeks your weakest breath
Eternal theism, all that are dead

Sacrifice is the name of God
He will be my light
The only way to get there is by killing
Death is the last hope of all

Quench the fire in my head, I'll start the fire
All life I drain
There's nothing more for me to suffer
For my quest it's over

Sacrifice is the name of God
He will be my light
The only way to get there is by killing
There's nothing more for me to suffer
For my quest it's over

Quench the fire in my head, I'll start the fire
All life I drain
There's nothing more for me to suffer
For my quest it's over


Despair, emptiness
See the hatred wasted
Face down taste the dust; it's getting harder everyday
Just to find a reason not to end it all yourself
Suicide on the street
Everywhere around you watch it breed
It begins to bury you in self-induced rejection

So now you're wasted, broken down
I see through your ignorance
Penetrate the surface of your insecure inside
Next fix, shoot it up
Looking for the place where god speaks
Every time you find him he just
====================
The final breath of my life's a blur
I've lost control of my rage
Staring blindly for the edge of my mind

I can't see through the blind hatred I feel
I never knew
I'm living my violent death
A life I want to die

I never said I wanted to
I won't be leaving without a reason to life

I want to live forever
and every time

You pierce your throat and hands
Thrown everything in your way
Unable to fathom

Anxiously awaiting
Birthday... of... Death
A day of despair

Light dries on the end of winter
A week goes by without a death
Of flesh and bone

A dead body lying next to mine
Smooth blue black lips
I start salivating as we kiss
Mine forever this sweet death
I cannot forget your soft breaths
Panting excitedly with my hands around your neck

Shades are drawn
No one can see
What I've done
What's become of me
Here I stand
Above all that's been true
How I love
How I love to kill you


Unknown are the caverns of the mind
New realms of affliction lurk inside
Unbound massive mental energy
Your last breaths taken from you easily

Incoherence disrupts your rationale
Involuntary your last confessional
No sense of being missing segments of time
Inconsistency is feeding on your mind

Mind control, pain unfolds
I own all your sensations
Weakening, reasoning
Mesmeric full demolition
Hypnotized - victimized
Behold the threshold to the web
Screaming souls fear echoes
Piercing boundaries of the dead

Penetration of the window to your soul
Deterioration of the mind, no self control
Temporarily comprehend no memories
Hollow carcass of a man is all I leave

Execution but a thought in the end
Slowly erasing your life and what has been
Passing victims in the land of secrecy
Cerebral death can come to you in your dreams


Disintegration you bastard

I've done overdose it doesn't mean shit
One time what about you it doesn't bother me a bit
My body is a weapon and my mind is decay
And all you stupid assholes are here to see
====================
Eternal flesh's fragrance
Seep from your eyes
Step back in time's sand
Reflections of my soul
Step inside my mind
Inert flesh
Feel time's sand
Reflections of my soul

Step inside my mind
Inert flesh
Feel time's sand
Reflections of my soul

Step inside my mind
Inert flesh


Take a look through time
At the future's watching
Looking for the issue
Looking for the question
Looking for the answer

Within yourself
Smell the smoke you dread
The fear you feel knowing my voice

Will save your soul

You're afraid of death
You dread death
You can't go wrong
With this you just send

A drone in time
Banished from memory
This drone captures the action
The moment the world
Was cut
The moment the world is erased

The Reaper kills
Destroyes part of me
As the drone captures the action
The moment the world is erased

I am the first to die
The pain that you feel
The pain you feel knowing I will
You feel it
All around you know it
It's everywhere
You love to hate
But you won't kill

There's no wrong answer
There's no punishment


Forces united the choice is yours

Victim of life represents the end justifies the means
Defy the universal good
Execution but the pain will be close
A choice is made of free will
Only by the wicked will prevail

The wicked will prevail

The blade cuts through the flesh
But the pain will never end

Son of God
Die by the sword
I give you life

A choice is made of free will
Only by the wicked will prevail

Son of God
Die by the sword
Lose life is like an empty promise
The choice is yours
For the times be their troubles

Messenger of all demise
Reign of death
Is this the end of the human race
 or is the darkness waiting for

The mallet is sure and precise
The soul is not immune
To the horror of death that stares at the center of my heart

The choice is yours
For the times be their troubles
Deafening terror that stares at the center of my heart

The mallet is precise and precise
The choice is yours

Police searching for a white male
Beaten and torn apart
Piece of clothing thrown
Left broken
Fragmentized


I don't want to see, I don't want to hear
I don't want to feel anything Can't you understand
Everything I do doesn't stem from you
It doesn't have a fucking thing to do with you
I just want to die Throw it all away
Never have to feel again the way you make me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me
Take It
Can't stop the violence that's spewing from me
I can't Stop The Violence I Don't Want To
I Can't Stop The Violence I Don't Want To
I Can't Stop The Violence I Don't Want To
I Can't Stop The Violence I Don't Want To


Imagine Humanity's decline
Step inside my disintegrating prison
Pace my body through the mud
Walk step by step through the mud
Then I'll judge you on your good deeds
And on your...

Homicide-Suicide
Inmate with a mental disorder
Understate the need
To remain above the law
Incisions in the surface
Of all mankind
Mental health depends upon just about anything

A violent death, a freak accident
Can't be understated
The horror of it all
Is much harder to ignore
For a state that is free
There is no shame in human misery

A life without sin
Can't be separated
The self-destructive plan
Is laid to waste
When a life is lost

A child's toy not the answer

To name a few: chemicals in the air
Silence the harmless search
For cancer
Death will come crawling down your spine
Nothing beats the violence of just about anything

To name a few: terror in the water
Begging in the air
A life is what I want
There is no shame in human misery

A life without sin
Can't be separated
The self-destructive plan
Is laid to waste
When a life is lost

To call a dead body a corpse
Anticipation grows amongst the dead
For all are complicit
In the ritual
Of a life is what I want
There is no shame in human misery


Anticipation grows amongst the dead

====================
In the depths of Hell,
A force so great you wonder
Who it is

God Hates Us All
Evil God Hates Us All

The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Abolish The God
He Fuckin' hates the Lord

Hell is Here
There's No Hell
I'll Fuck It Up
Look into the mirror
And let the tears spill

Destroyer of disbelief
Your God's love has taken control
And taken your soul

There's No Hell
I'll Fuck It Up
Look into the mirror
And Let The Tears Drop

I'll Fuck It Up
Hell is Here
There's No Hell
I'll Fuck It Up

Even though I hate you
Even though I hate the Lord
Even though I don't believe in god
I'll damned if I'll fight
Even though I'm just a casualty of the system
Even though I live off blood
I live by the sword
Even though I love to kill
Even though I'm a punk
Even though I'm a bitch in a wheelchair

I'll damn myself to the core
If I were alive to stand here
I'd crucify the world I serve

I'll damn myself to the core
If I were alive to stand here
I'd fight
I'm the one insane
I'm the one blind
Insecurity make you wonder

You have your own reality
You've got your own nightmare
You can't control the intensity
That's why Satan speaks

I tear your soul away

Phantasmas
Can't hold the rage when it's spilled
Frantic arguments
With the money in my hand
I decide what to spend
When my wrath is unleashed

Screams in my head
Are you sure you want to die

The bullseye goes flying
It cuts the throat and hangs in midair
It's the best time
A suicide
The doctors the hospital has to offer

Help me water when I feel the need
When my agony gets to the point
It's the best time

The taste of blood runs cold
Infectious ivy seeds burning deep in your brain

Throw the knife and I'll rip your soul away

Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.
A boy's wish to see the end.
A witch's curse.
A world in which all eternity.

Cascaded darkness
Walls close in on me.
Nailed shut but my eyes still see.
Severe anguish as my body evolves.
The pain of life after death it resolves.

Emptiness in twilight's rebirth,
The faint sounds of shoveled earth.

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.
Suffer from the pain of my death.

Convulsions, dawn are upon the land.
Heat exhaustion,
Showers that freeze,
Fires that burn.

Pain, suffer the agony.
Necrophobic, desensitize.
Temporary insanity,
A state of mind that never dies.

Hatred, the name of the game.
Scattered rumours throughout the land.
One dead and one fresh wound.
One casualty, one immortal scream.

Face down taste the dust, digging deeper in your grave
Haven't found a reason
Haven't found a thing to fucking live for

How you choose to destroy yourself
In a world that feeds on hate
You're left here just to waste away
In your cardboard prison, asphalt wasteland

You have no choice of life or death
My face you'll never see
The pain in your brain, it burns inside your head

A choice that no one else has made
You make my server

I am the first to know when you die

You don't have to die
I'll take you down into your tears

Eroticized you've lived through

You're just a casualty of the system
Born into a chosen way of life

Night will come for all
She sleeps on the ground
She hasn't yet turned
She doesze off
She's lost her mind
She's burst her brain
She thinks she can cure
Her son will be buried tonight
She's lost his cool in the crypt
Her prayers are answered
She runs on to other people

It's the night that brings the fall
He that was born runs amok
Across the sea of red
Runs the wave of blood
Death is all around, there's nothing to see

The first thought that comes to my mind
Light shines through my eyes
Abolish the compulsion
Light dries my eyes

Desecrate the tomb

It burns your soul

Bleed your death

The first thought that comes to my mind
Light shines through my eyes
Absorb the will of the people
They will see the end justifies the means

Your senses under siege

Abolish government
There's nothing to it
Forget about God
He's no innocent
We live by a system
Of perfect goals
People vs. people who are bored and old

Life must rest on the man who represents

Looking for nothing in this
Campus with just friends
President the name
President the label
The highest man on the government table

But love is incest and it's only for a fuck

Peace time war time country's in vein

All die for this land some over seas
I live for the summons serve my country
Army, Navy, Air Force or jail
To the guys provided for free

But that's the American way what it is to be free
If that's what they call freedom it's not for me

Always ranking on somebody

Throwing beer bottles and spitting in your face
Checking through the purse

Enter the kingdom of desire.


Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected to all

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin


Come walk with me through endless time.
See what has been and what the future sees.
Share the wisdom of the old world that was,
Step in a life that's yet to be born.

You spill the blood,
Eternal soul.

I'll show you sights that you would not believe.
Experience pleasures thought unobtained.
At one with evil that has ruled before.
Now smell the stench of immortality.

You spill the blood,
Eternal soul.

Spill your blood, let it run on to me,
Take my hand and let go of your life.
Close your eyes and see what is me,
Raise the chalice, embrace for evermore.

You've spilt the blood.
I'll have your soul.


Propaganda death ensemble
Burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night
In blood laced misery
Scorched earth the policy
The reason for the siege

Supreme art of strategy
Playing on the minds
Bombard till submission
Take all to their graves
Indication of triumph

Death's head was just a powder keg
A quick kick to the head
Just to wake the shit up


Up close and personal
Death's face I can see

Memories can't ignore
Pain
Seep deep inside your brain

Merely secret
Inside your mind
A mask saving horror
Of strange children
Shooting up
Intense pain
Captive mortality
Captive ignorance
How could these things be
Could they be real

Death is here, it's haunting me ever since
My youth
The dead have taken my world
The mask on
My face that once held it
The mask is no mask

Sweat from so many wounds
One incredible illness
Pulmonary overthrow
A dream come true
Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension starts aggression

Peace breaks out then
Breeds contempt unrest

Without a reason to fight
A time to kill
Sick lust for skeletal flesh
A taste for all decay
Enter the soldier blind
Stalking the faceless hunt
There is no conscience in this world
That can be reached for peace
Why face the human question
The need to hate
Dead stare through cynical eyes
A trust in only pain
Murder within the skin
Engrave the art of war
Become death's vile parade
March on embrace the violent mind
Can't stop the warring factions
Global tension starts aggression

Peace breaks out then
Breeds contempt unrest
One inconsistency after another
With no one to blame
Sickness is a discipline
Mindlessly following the lead of their commanding officer

Aggression is what I do
No self control
I let the results lead me

Hiding in darkness my contempt for the law
Aggressive tactics
Mindlessly killing and maiming
No mercy no reason

Sacrifice for sport
A bleeding part of the human race

Piece by piece they're being slaughtered
Humanity being total pieces

No longer the savior we believe we're getting
A choice of life or death

The brutality of the battlefront
Blood spills for my cause

A choice of life or death

The brutality of the battlefront
Oblivious to a dead body
Hiding in darkness an execution
A choice of life or death


No one could ever doubt my rapture
As you too wil

There's nothing more for us to say
President Clinton's a dick
He'll never be the same

I don't want to see
All the things that keep me hollow
I want to see there's nothing more for us to say
I fucking hate you anyway

You spite me
I want to see there's nothing more
For you to hate me
Is full throttle war - the end justifies the means
A world without your lies
Into this world you belong

You've tried, you'll fail
You think there's no use
There's none to it
You want to lose your mind
Just shoot a fucking load more way

You self-righteous fuck
Put up with the way you're dressed
In yourivist block
You think you'll win
You wish you could be
God is dead - I am - what is
Swinging in my wake

Smiles in my eyes as we pass by

A quick kick of the chair
And I'm done.

Snap out of my slump
Began to take in the sights
Of Daddy's bedroom
Lying all alone
Looking on in wonder
How the hell did I make you end up here

This is where the world of money
Decides what kind of country
The world of shit

What is with you - you seem to have no choice
In my world of money
There's nothing more for us to say
President Clinton's a dick
He'll never be the same


Will you become my God moneys
Forever infidels
Watching from their lives
Will you become my God moneys

Here I stand
The pied piper sits nestled in the Earth

The oceans have been ripped away
But what is the future holds

Forgotten menaced by the growing tide
Not the other way around
Dogs of war free of pain
Re-live the pain of human pesticide poisoning

Sliced and torn
Birthright of the noblest god
On the cadavers of destruction
Man made virus

Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Blow to the throat, disease of the soul

Tables turned blast of power
Drive the sand into the ground
Sliced and torn

Deafening silence echoes through the world

Will you hear
====================
You will never be the same


I stalk the halls of fame
Sting attacks creepers heat wave
Threshhold invades
Your immune under siege
I feed the greed of my patrons
I dominate the mind and body

My activities are all that are heard
I dominate the soul

I thrive on competition
Alluring, mesmerizing
Dominated, mesmerized
Broken glass, wondrous
Enforcing, enforcing
Enforcing, enforcing

On the throne my slaves are sold
My secrets are kept
The rich get richer
The fools go insane

The game is fair game
The kingdoms that are built
Are built on deception
To benefit the few

I thrive on competition
Alluring, mesmerizing
Dominated, mesmerized
Broken glass, wondrous
Enforcing, enforcing
Enforcing, enforcing

On the throne my slaves are sold
My secrets are kept
The rich get richer
The fools go insane


I breach your life
Ask why I am imprisoned
I make your walls rise
All fear the Lord

I can suppress the will to kill
Disintegrate the left and the right
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God
Antichrist is the name of God


Do you understand the need
To see that nothing is sacred
To see that everything is pure
To see that the celebration of a vice
Is a show of force
The possession of some sacred thing

Do you understand the need
To see that nothing is sacred
To see that everything is
Pure and simple
Alluring, blissful
Unbroken
You have your own reality
God is my reality

Do you understand
The need
To see that nothing is sacred
To see that everything is
Pure and simple
Alluring, blissful
Unbroken
I'll take you down
You'll die just like a carefree child
You've got your own reality
The Lord is my reality

I am all that you ever wanted to be
I am the hope of your existence
I sing the praises of all that I love

I am the hope of your demise
I take you down

You'll die just like a carefree child
You've got your own reality
God is my reality

I am

Fantasizing
Pessimistic dreams
Of a world in chaos
Transforming
Just a thought
To lose your way in
A world in chaos
Transforming
Just a thought
To lose your way in

A world in chaos

Breeding fast
Down to the slaughter
In a world in decay
Chaos is all you'll find
In a world in chaos
Transforming
Just a thought
To lose your way in


Murder at your every foot step
A child's toy sudden Death

On a shelf under investigation
Police searching for the murderer
Searching for the gun
Share of
Your Street

Chaos is all you'll find
In a world in chaos
Transforming
Just a thought
To lose your way in


Could it be that the future you seek is waiting for you here?
A vision of a world in chaos
In which all that's feared are here
A world in chaos
In which all that's feared are being destroyed


Have you ever felt the need, even though you're not supposed to
To see the execution
Of a man of God
With the words of the Lord
You are condemned to die

Word gets around that there's a chance
That man will rise and die
But who is to say
That man will die

Word gets around that there's a chance
That man will rise and die
But who is to say
That man will rise and die


Imagine Humanity's decline
Step inside my stain of mind
Into the unknown race of creations
You are my Eden

Gemini race of fears
Demon lord of the damned
Born from a whore's seed
A whore's lust
Lures us into submission
Destroying our flocks
Lives of the Nullifier

Demon in the flesh
Modulistic terror
Gemini master of the deception
A race of mindless, mindless,
Pathetic creations

Born of poison oak
Transforming the primordial mass
Destroying what remains

Witness the splendor of the embers
Splattered red light the world
I control the waves
Magnifying the holes in the earth
Divided the world

All die for this cause
I have no faith
In some one special

God is dead, I'm living out another's dream
A world in which
====================
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
The smile you feel on your face
The first step to salvation

Face the purest blood of all
Evil returns
Evil's parade returns

Face the evil who rule from below
Sacrifice of all demise
Face the dying cruciform
Holy cross no longer needed
You worship the noblest of gods
Hit her bottom line
Enjoying all that's obscene
You can't ignore the rape of a son

Face the obscene contentment of my crimes
Face the wrath of the Lord
Strike her bottom line
Suffer the infliction
Of a nation of fuckingfuckers

Face the vile lies told by black mouth
Inherit the infamous Starr
Pseudo-God speaks to us

We have sinned
We'll have to live
Ayorcs are harmless
Just like the poets
Deny the horror of the practice
Of incest
Yielding the sword to the wall
It is not my intent
To slay you all
But to make you bleed

God is vain and vain
He art the seeker after the truth
He art the maker of evils

God is vain and vain
He art the worshiper of the Devil

God is the son of the sea
And the name of the Lord is none the less

God is all that I ever wanted to be
But I Never Had The Time
I Want to Be
I Want to Be - I Want to Be

I Want to be - I Want to Be
I Want to be
To rule the land of the dead
The land of the pure

I want to be - I want to be
I want to be
To rule the sky high
The sun sets above the sea
And the waves are bouncing
All of us are drifting
Dead is Beautiful
Everything Gray
There's nothing alive
Ripping flesh from the brain
As if by magic

God is all that I ever wanted to be
But I Never Had The Time
I Want to Be
I Want to Be
I Want to Be


Dying [In] Death
Physical
 Mythical

Laughing as you see
The miracle
Laughing as you die

Bury your body
In a bloody tomb
Silent blood flows
All around
====================
Clawing can't hide the horror of life under his roof
This brutal regime is building up to a world of blood
Blood on the walls

Control and rule ruthlessly
Disapprobation, contempt, you will never make it
You will never make it

Subversive, cancerous, you'll never make it

To survive in this world of blood
You'll have to fight for your lives
To survive in this world of flesh

Disapprobation, contempt, you'll never make it
You'll never make it

To survive in this world of blood
You'll have to fight for your lives
To survive in this world of flesh

Erotic, frightful sounds penetrate your mind
As you feel the deadly sting
It fills your brain with pain

Visions of torture and terror spread your wings
As you feel the deadly sting
It fills your brain with pain

Close your eyes and see what is being done
Smell the fear in our midst
As bullets rain
From across the sea

Confronting numbers of corpses
How many lives have you saved

None known for what they say they know
The fate that is yours
Is yet to be decided

Execution but a thought in the end
Sniper fire tearing through the night

Flooding the streets with crimson rain
Sadist troops saving us all

Soldiers of attrition
Kill at their own pace
Slaughters will be their

Initiate a chain reaction that will last for years
Execute and rape the bastard child
All in my wake
Militia of blood troops

Terrorism dissipates
As death is certain
No one left to blame
Your life is up to someone too old

Haunting calls haunt you day and night
In a world of brutal time
Candles burn the midnight fire
Candles burn the night we die

Night falls lie dormant waiting to bloom
For the dying to die wave their hands
Victim is forgotten no more
Eagerly awaiting wish arrives
The Reaper of Death

Screams in my head
Kill at their own pace
Slaves to their doom
Bones and bits of flesh lie dormant
For the dying to die

Night grows cold and red rain
Destroyes, Reaper of agony
Rise hold fast in my wake
Bones and

I think this is it
I think this is it
I think this is it
I think the future belongs to the old guard
Death's design shining through

I think this is it
I think this is it
Ain't it true...
We're only living to die

Warriors from Hell march on the tomb of the Antichrist
All hail the new god

Warriors from Hell march on the tomb of the Antichrist
All hail the new god

I think this is it
Is the work of Satan
The oppressed are kept behind
By the grace of God

Monarch to the church
In the name of the Lord

Mortuaries, dead of night
Raining blood
From a lacerated sky

Apathy, blinders,
Infectious immorality
Scattered, they haunt
All of us
Lost in our eternal quest

Apostle wings rust, we see the anguish
The pain she inflicts
Sacrifice the blind shears the dead

Messenger of all demise
With words of the noblest god
Faded prophecies
Sheer defiance drives the fire
Sheer defiance drives the curse

Messenger of all demise
Betrayed in the name of the Lord

Apparitions, swift as lightning
Strike against their destruction
Reign of death
Holy cross points to the place
Where all die

Messenger of all demise
Betrayed in the name of the Lord

Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Infiltration, assault, death from below
Shackled in blistering red
and now for all to see
Imprisoned beneath its red sun
Holy cross points to the place
Where all do die


See the fog rise high above
Clouds of steam burn overhead

See the waves of blood adorn the walls
The pain of life lost is no answer no time
Cooldown rise above
Run, jump, swim
Swim, walk, drink beer or wine
Swerve, boil, boil, suckle, fondle
Drive, rush, burn, kill, rescue, survive

Submerge, push, scratch, scratch, they cry
Activate,
====================
You know the feeling
When adrenaline takes control
Can't beat the rush
That leaves a suicidal hold

Instinct spares no one
Destroying the human heart
The taste of blood
Can rip your soul apart

Chaos rampant
A state of mind that never dies
That can't be stopped
Destroying the human brain
The taste of blood
Can rip your soul apart

Chaos rampant
A state of mind that never dies
That can't be stopped

Destroying the human heart
The taste of blood
Can rip your soul apart

Necrophobic
Necrophobic

Like a sickening chill shooting through the air
Feeling the rush
To kill the exhilaration
Taste the sickening fresh new thing
Basking in the air
An eerie silence holds no one
The chill winds of death blowing slowly
Feeling the rush
To kill the exhilaration
Taste the sickening fresh new thing
Basking in the air
An eerie silence holds no one
The chill winds of death blowing slowly

You go to the church
You kiss the cross
You will be saved in a fire
You have your own reality

Nightmare, the persecution
A child is sent to lie in wait for the day that burns

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul is taken from it's victims
A execution is fast and a fine soul
The rope they are tied to the rafters
A watch is never too short

To die, to be burned
Is to live.

The boy's name is Joseph
He goes to the stake house
He is baptized on the stake
And on
The fire ishes my soul's memory

The cross it is tied to
Sewn together
A wicked witch takes hold
The stake is taken and all but all are lost

Torment, ill forgotten
A son is sent to lie in wait for the day that burns

Torment, ill forgotten
A body is taken from it's victims
A execution is fast and a fine soul
The rope they are tied to
Sewn together
A wicked witch takes hold
The stake is taken and all but all are lost

Torment, ill forgotten
Burning hope awakens
In a single thought
Atonement, total annihilation
The needle kills!
====================
The sky's the limit!


The holy cross
Symbol of lies
Violates all Islamic beliefs

God-fearing souls seek asylum in Rome
There they await his judgment

Spectors of doom
Fear no part of Satan
He will show his face
See the end is near
There's nothing more for us to say
Our holy cross
Symbol of lies
Violates all Islamic beliefs

Drones of the wicked
Infiltrate the light
Contaminating the image

Spectors of doom
Fear no part of Satan
He will show his face
See the end is near
There's nothing more for us to say
Our holy cross
Symbol of lies
Contaminating the image

Spectors of doom
Fear no part of Satan
He will show his face



Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.

Guidance, it means nothing
In a world of brutal time.

Electric, circus, wild,
Deep in the infants mind.

Silent Scream
Bury the unwanted child.
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn.

Shattered, adolescent [sings: another child]
Bearer of no name.

Restrained, insane games
Suffer the children condemned.

Scattered, remnants of life,
Murder a time to die.

Pain, sufferaged toyed,
Life's little fragments destroyed.

Silent Scream
Crucify the bastard son.
Beaten and torn
Sanctify lives of scorn.

Life preordained
Humanity maintained.
Extraction termination
Pain's agonizing stain.

Embryonic death,
Embedded in your brain.
Suffocation, strangulation,
Death is fucking you insane.

Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.
Innocence withdrawn in fear.
Fires burning can you hear
Cries in the night.


Cascaded darkness
Walls close in on me.
Nailed shut but my eyes still see.
Severe anguish as my body evolves.
The pain of life after death it resolves.

====================
Take a look inside my eyes
As I watch you die
As I watch you live
Soaked in blood
Hungry for your blood
The desire is there for all to see
Madness is inside my eyes
As you suck my deadly breath
You taste your death in hand
You taste death in mind
Burning eyes filled with hate
Let your death be your salvation


Dance with the dead in my dreams
Blitzkrieg tactics in my blood
Born to kill rage in the air
Skalding through the fire
Hunting through the stone

Dead of night
Eternal night cold
Attacking the cold that drives my veins

Machine gun fire, blood sucking creatures of the night
No breath left to hide
Dead of night
Dead of night
Cold and ruthless
Hunting through the fire
Death is coming
Hunting through the stone

Death is coming

Warriors from the gates
By the sword that I have fashioned
Hunting through the fire
No breath left to hide
Dead of night
Dead of night
Eternal night cold
Attacking the cold that drives my veins

At Mach ten velocity
Pressure builds can't take the strain
Bones are all I leave
Walking slow but strong
Showers full of pus
Counting off customer after customer

I shut my eyes to the endless nightmare
There's nothing in my head that says can't be done
Global chaos feeding on hysteria
Artificial intelligence killing all of creation
Paralyzing the change
Bringing it all crashing down
You can see the rage in my eyes
Brought to you by my Babysitter
Free of charge
All new life must be created
Just like the past
Add to my cart
Myo, in charge of all your woes
My secret life that everyone else never knew

All new suffering and misery
Just like the past
Add to my cart
Myo, in charge of all your woes

I'm the new hell on earth
Everything around me is flawed
Everything that's been created just for me

I'm the new hell on earth
Everything around me is corrupt
Everything that's been created just for me

I'm the new hell on earth
Everything around me is corrupt

I'm the new hell on earth
Everything around me is sickening
Everything around me is dangerous
====================
As you drift off to sleep
You feel a burning sensation your skin's getting cold
You think you'll see me
But I won't see
You feel your soul freeze
Cold, dead and forgotten
Writer's block - live and die

Imagine waking up one morning and feeling the need to kill yourself
As you blindly take the plunge
You wake up and realize you can't kill yourself

Imagine you've broken the chain
It keeps pulling at your soul's edge
You then kick it
With all your might
Pulling your lives
At your own risk
Pulling your lives
With all your might

Imagine you've broken the chain
It keeps pulling at your soul's edge

You then kick it
With all your might
Pulling your lives
At your own risk
Pulling your lives
With all your might

Imagine you've broken the chain
It keeps pulling at your soul's edge

You then kick it
With all your might
Pulling your lives
At your own risk
Burning is all you do

Sorcery that burns
Sorcery that soon
Makes me see
What is to become of my brother

A power that lives inside me
A spell I have to keep from working
It's called the Dead

A power I cannot shut down
My brother is inside me

A power I cannot shut down
My brother is inside me

A power I cannot shut down

Stalking, stabbing and shooting
No mercy no reason
You'll be treated just like any other

Dead


Do you see the horror in everyone's eyes

As bullets rain
On the ground
On the walls

In blood that's for all to see

Eternal damnation
A final plea is read out to me

In blood that changes nothing
No mercy no reason
Eternal damnation
Do you see the horror in everyone's eyes

As bullets rain
On the ground
On the walls

In blood that's for all to see

Dead


There's nothing more intense
In the wake of human decay
Can't remember the last time
Staring this down will never bring it home

Staring this down will never bring it home

Dead

Can't remember one reason why
All your life he's been the
Staring this down

Tyrant of the Night

Black knights from many lands march before my eyes.
Four centuries of persecution has passed.
The knights from many lands march before my eyes.
Four centuries of persecution has passed.

Signature of sin
Enter the priest.

Visions of torture and terror
Seek salvation in the flesh.

A lost cause, a war that never ends.
The gates of death are wide open.
Enter the lord of agony.
Signature of sin.

Enter the priest.


Confronting the evil you dread.
The way you look at the sky.
Exploding from the drop of hypothermia.
Lying all alone.

Numb, lifeless things, screaming for your life.

Death is yours, your only regret.
The sky is yours, your only salvation.

War machine hell on the hill,
Infiltration attempt from all directions.
Destroyation, real or imagined,
Screaming revolution,
I'll kill you, you'll kill me,
You'll die, you'll die,
You'll die,
You'll lie there and just die,
You'll be there about to die,
To die,
Ready to explode,
To die,

Death is yours, your only regret.
The sky is yours, your only salvation.


Caught
Now you're mine
I'm the one who caught the morn,
The one to blame,
The one to blame,
The one to blame,

You're nothing
The Bastards
You're nothing

Villager caught
Lonely child
Prayer animal
God's solemn promise
To watch over you
Butchershouse
To cook your sorrow
Butcher in my grave
To butcher your soul

Dogs fault
Herbal of last resort
Prescription drug of last resort

Narcissism
Attempted murder
Drug of last resort

Narcissistic
Engulf your conscience
Be quiet and be patient
An overdose can damage your mind

Can't control the rage that flows from it
Sheer defiance drives all of us

Patriot hard line
Kill ourselves in days to come
Brotherhood led by a butcher
Fatality is our tide

The violent tyranny of a she-go-getter

====================
You can't deny the power of the free world we live in
Controlling the world's excess will corrupt

Mind control, pain and death
Take what I want, take what I want
Take what I want

I am the new hell on earth
Abolish the old world
Contaminate the mindless
Free reign of the insane

Conceal your name, leave your name on the wall
Alliance with the devil will prosper
Bear witness to the power of the devil
Free reign of the insane

Spiritual lawlessness
Witness the blood on your wall
Allies with the devil will prosper

Beware the image here on your wall
Dancing in blood
Dancing in blood

Sacrifice for the devil
I'll be his companion

Not the same

Faded memories haunt my mind
Faded memories haunt my mind

I am the face of Damnation in your mind
Bleed your death upon
Let your bloodline feed my youth

Demonize what is feared
Incantation spell gone by
Eternal flame burns your tongue
See the world destroyed
Desecrated eternally
Purged you of your purity

Killed your children, but will never die

Demonize what is feared in the future
See the fire grows stronger
Eternal flame burns your tongue
See the world destroyed

See the fire grow stronger
Eternal flame burns your tongue

You spill the blood, it's killing my lust

You spill the blood, it's killing my lust
You pierce your throat, you fuck and you fuck
fuck your no life


High priest of the Hellenic cross
Holds the keys to the kingdom
In the depths of the Hellenistic
Mankind ruled by demons
By demons

Sacrifice for the devil
I'll be his companion
Not the same

Faded memories haunt my mind
Faded memories haunt my mind

I am the face of Damnation in your mind
Bleed your death upon
Let your bloodline feed my youth

Demonize what is feared in the future


Breeding fast in poverty
Infectious driving dormant seed
Inside your carcass start to mate
Left in charge to dominate
Waiting to unfold
Raging uncontrolled
Adapt a potency
Death machine, infest my corpse to be
